        "full_text": "Organizations now use an average of 112 SaaS applications\u2014a number that keeps growing. In a 2024 study, 49% of 644 respondents who frequently used Microsoft 365 believed that they had less than 10 apps connected to the platform, despite the fact that aggregated data indicated over 1,000+ Microsoft 365 SaaS-to-SaaS connections on average per deployment. And that's just one major SaaS provider. Imagine other unforeseen critical security risks:\n\nEach SaaS app has unique security configurations \u2014making misconfigurations a top risk.\n\n\u2014making misconfigurations a top risk. Business-critical apps (CRM, finance, and collaboration tools) store vast amounts of sensitive data, making them prime targets for attackers.\n\n(CRM, finance, and collaboration tools) store vast amounts of sensitive data, making them prime targets for attackers. Shadow IT and third-party integrations introduce hidden vulnerabilities that often go unnoticed.\n\nintroduce hidden vulnerabilities that often go unnoticed. Large and small third-party AI service providers (e.g. audio/video transcription service) may not comply with legal and regulatory requirements, or properly test and review code.\n\nMajor SaaS providers also have thousands of developers pushing changes every day. Understanding each SaaS app, assessing risks, and securing configurations is overwhelming and inhumanly possible. And much of it is just noise. Perhaps nothing malicious is going on at scale, but small details can often be overlooked.\n\nTraditional security approaches simply cannot scale to meet these demands, leaving organizations exposed to potential breaches.\n\nAI: The Only Way to Keep Up\n\nThe complexity of SaaS security is outpacing the resources and effort needed to secure it. AI is no longer optional, it's essential. AI-driven security solutions like AskOmni by AppOmni\u2014which combine Generative AI (or GenAI) and advanced analytics\u2014are transforming SaaS security by:\n\n\u2713 Delivering instant security insights through conversational AI.\n\n\u2713 Investigating security events efficiently.\n\n\u2713 Turning complex SaaS security questions into clear, actionable answers.\n\n\u2713 Visualizing risks for deeper understanding.\n\n\u2713 Breaking language barriers\u2014multi-lingual support enables security teams to interact with AI in Japanese, French, and English. With multi-lingual support, teams worldwide can interact with security data in their native language\u2014enhancing accessibility and response times.\n\nFor example, with its ability to stitch together context from disparate data points, AskOmni can notify administrators about issues caused by overprovisioning of privileges, taking into account access patterns, sensitive data, or compliance requirements, and guide them through the remediation process. Beyond typical threat notifications, AskOmni alerts administrators to new threats, explaining potential consequences and offering prioritized remediation steps.\n\nThe Power of AI + Data Depth\n\nHigh-quality data is the fuel that powers GenAI, but it's often in short supply. While GenAI is increasingly used to create synthetic data for simulations, detection testing, or red-teaming exercises, the quality of that data determines the effectiveness of the outcomes.\n\nGenerative models require clean, relevant, and unbiased datasets to avoid producing inaccurate or misleading results. That's a major challenge in cybersecurity domains where high-fidelity threat intel, logs, and labeled incident data are scarce or siloed.\n\nFor instance, building a GenAI model to simulate cloud breach scenarios demands access to detailed, context-rich telemetry\u2014something that's not always available due to privacy concerns or lack of standardized formats.\n\nBut GenAI can be a powerful tool that can automate threat research to accelerate incident reporting, helping streamline workflows for researchers, engineers, and analysts alike. Its success, however, depends on solving the data quality and availability gap first.\n\nIn SaaS security, finding fast, actionable answers traditionally means sifting through data, which can be time-consuming and requires expertise.\n\nAI is only as effective as the data it analyzes. The ability to analyze security events allows AI to provide deep visibility into SaaS environments and detect threats with greater accuracy. Security teams benefit from AI's ability to prioritize risks, correlate complex security observations, and provide recommendations grounded in real-world expertise.\n\nWith 101+ million users secured and 2+ billion security events processed daily, AppOmni ensures:\n\nDeep visibility into SaaS environments\n\nAccurate risk detection and prioritization\n\nActionable security insights grounded in expertise\n\nReal-World Impact: AI in Action\n\nA global enterprise recently leveraged AI to assess its complex SaaS environment. With just a few prompts, AskOmni efficiently analyzed the system and highlighted key areas for focus. AskOmni provided the following insights that one customer was able to immediately action and remediate:\n\nAn application bypassing IP restrictions : a critical misconfiguration.\n\n: a critical misconfiguration. Unauthorized self-authorization in Salesforce : a major security gap.\n\n: a major security gap. Outdated high-risk applications: flagged before they could be exploited.\n\nWithout AI, identifying these risks would have taken hours or been missed entirely.\n\nThe Present and Future Belongs to AI-Driven SaaS Security\n\nAI is not just enhancing the security of SaaS applications \u2014 it's redefining what is possible. Organizations using AI-powered security tools will gain a critical edge in protecting their data and staying ahead of cyber threats.\n\nStop searching, start asking.

        "full_text": "Have you ever walked through a city and felt like every building had a story to tell?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how I felt in Colombia. You\u2019ll see clay homes built by Indigenous communities, Spanish churches with red-tile roofs, and sleek glass towers\u2014all sharing the same streets.\n\nIt\u2019s like the past and present are having a conversation right in front of you.\n\nColombia\u2019s architecture shows where it has been and where it is going. It\u2019s bold, colorful, and full of character.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me and love when a place feels alive through its design, you\u2019re in for a treat.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the streets of Colombia together\u2014and see how its architecture tells the story of its people.\n\nColonial Architecture in Colombia\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived in Colombia, they brought a new way of building towns.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice streets laid out in neat grids, with a main plaza at the center. These plazas often had a church, a government building, and space for people to gather.\n\nMany of these early buildings still stand today. They were built with local materials like adobe and stone but followed Spanish designs with arches, columns, and thick walls.\n\nThis mix of European planning and local technique shaped how cities grew\u2014and still shapes them now.\n\nNotable Colonial Cities and Sites\n\nIf you enjoy walking through history, you\u2019ll love these places:\n\nCartagena : Visit San Felipe Castle and Las B\u00f3vedas near the walled city\n\n: Visit San Felipe Castle and Las B\u00f3vedas near the walled city Bogot\u00e1 : Stop by the Santa Clara Church and Quinta de Bol\u00edvar\n\n: Stop by the Santa Clara Church and Quinta de Bol\u00edvar Barichara and Mompox: Small towns with cobblestone streets and well-kept colonial homes\n\nEach spot gives you a different view of Colombia\u2019s colonial past.\n\nCommon Features and Materials\n\nColonial architecture in Colombia has a style that\u2019s easy to spot once you know what to look for.\n\nMost buildings have an inner courtyard. These open spaces bring in sunlight and help cool the home, especially in warm regions.\n\nRoofs are usually made with red clay tiles, while the walls are built with adobe or stone. These materials were easy to find and worked well with the climate.\n\nYou\u2019ll often see wooden balconies facing the street. They weren\u2019t just for looks\u2014they were used for watching parades, markets, and daily life outside.\n\nMany buildings also feature carved details around doors and windows. These Spanish Baroque elements gave a touch of art and beauty while still feeling grounded in local tradition.\n\nRepublican and Modernist Colombia Architecture\n\nRepublican and Post-Colonial Architecture\n\nAfter Colombia gained independence, the focus of architecture began to shift.\n\nBuildings were no longer just for the church\u2014they were now for the people. You\u2019ll see this in the rise of public spaces and government buildings that were meant to serve the growing nation.\n\nTwo standout examples are the Capitolio Nacional, where laws are made, and the Teatro Col\u00f3n, known for its beauty and performances.\n\nDuring this time, architects leaned into neoclassical styles\u2014grand columns, domes, and symmetry\u2014but still used local materials.\n\nThis marked a move from religious to civic pride in design.\n\nRogelio Salmona and the Rise of Modernism\n\nRogelio Salmona changed the way people thought about buildings in Colombia.\n\nHe used red brick in bold, creative ways. His designs included open spaces, gardens, and flowing water, all meant to connect people to their surroundings.\n\nOne of his most famous works is Torres del Parque in Bogot\u00e1. It\u2019s not just a group of towers\u2014it\u2019s a blend of homes, nature, and public areas that still feels fresh today.\n\nSalmona\u2019s work helped shape what modern Colombian architecture looks like now.\n\nColombian Architects Shaping the Future\n\nToday, a new group of architects is making their mark.\n\nOne of the most well-known is Giancarlo Mazzanti. He focuses on schools, parks, and libraries\u2014places built for everyday people.\n\nHis designs often use bold shapes and bright colors, but they always keep one thing in mind: people first.\n\nOther architects are following this path, too. They\u2019re mixing smart design with the real needs of growing cities.\n\nThis blend of care, creativity, and innovative design in Colombia is helping shape its future\u2014one building at a time.\n\nContemporary and Sustainable Colombia Architecture\n\nWorking with the Landscape and Community\n\nWhen I visited Medell\u00edn, one thing stood out\u2014the buildings were made to help people, not just impress them.\n\nYou\u2019ll see this clearly in projects like the Metrocable, which links hillside neighborhoods to the rest of the city. It\u2019s not just transportation\u2014it\u2019s a lifeline.\n\nThe library parks are another great example. These public spaces were designed so people could read, gather, and feel connected to their community.\n\nIn Colombia, architecture often solves real-life problems. This kind of people-centered design plays a big role in community development and shows how thoughtful planning can truly change lives.\n\nIntegration of Technology and Sustainability\n\nI\u2019ve always been interested in how buildings work with nature instead of fighting it\u2014and Colombia does this really well.\n\nMany new buildings use guadua, a native bamboo that\u2019s strong, light, and easy to grow. You\u2019ll also see green rooftops, rainwater systems, and designs that bring in natural light and fresh air.\n\nThese features aren\u2019t just \u201cnice to have\u201d\u2014they help reduce energy use and fit the local climate.\n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here is a steady shift toward sustainable architecture in Colombia. And it\u2019s not just for big projects\u2014these ideas are showing up in homes, schools, and community centers across the country.\n\nVivid Colors and Modern Shapes\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that sticks with me about modern Colombian buildings, it\u2019s the color.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice homes painted in bright blues, oranges, and greens. Public buildings often feature large murals, curved shapes, and playful designs that make them stand out. This is not just for style\u2014it reflects the culture\u2019s creativity and energy.\n\nThis use of bold color and form is a key part of Colombian architectural identity today. It\u2019s expressive, modern, and rooted in a deep sense of pride.\n\nAnd when you see it in person, you can feel how much it matters to the people who live there.\n\nRegional Variations in Colombia Architecture\n\nCoastal Areas (Cartagena, Santa Marta)\n\nWhen you walk around Cartagena or Santa Marta, you\u2019ll feel how the buildings work with the sea.\n\nYou\u2019ll see old forts, like San Felipe Castle, built to protect the coast. Colonial homes here are designed to handle heat and humidity, with wide windows, tall ceilings, and breezy layouts that let air flow through.\n\nMany use courtyards and thick walls to stay cool\u2014great examples of tropical architecture that prioritizes comfort while remaining beautiful.\n\nAndean Region (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn)\n\nIn the Andes, everything changes\u2014especially how buildings are shaped. The land is steep, and the cities are packed with energy.\n\nIn Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn, you\u2019ll notice tall buildings that make the most of narrow city spaces. Earthquake safety is also a big focus here.\n\nThese cities offer a mix of urban Colombian buildings and preserved colonial streets. It\u2019s where the old and new sit side by side, and it somehow works.\n\nAmazon and Orinoco Regions\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how people build in hot, rainy places, the Amazon and Orinoco regions have the answer.\n\nMany Indigenous homes are raised off the ground to stay dry and catch breezes. Roofs are large and sloped to keep rain out.\n\nThese simple, smart structures show how vernacular architecture in Colombia fits the land perfectly\u2014without needing much more than nature provides.\n\nCoffee Region (Salento, Filandia)\n\nIn places like Salento and Filandia, the homes are just as colorful as the landscape.\n\nYou\u2019ll see bright fa\u00e7ades, wooden balconies, and walls made with bahareque, a mix of bamboo and mud. This style has been used for generations.\n\nThis region is known for its charm, and the buildings reflect that. It\u2019s a picture-perfect example of rural Colombian architecture at its best.\n\nSmall Towns with Big History\n\nIf you\u2019re into quiet towns that feel frozen in time, you\u2019ll love Barichara, Mompox, and Villa de Leyva.\n\nThese places are full of cobblestone streets, whitewashed walls, and tiled roofs. Most buildings have been carefully preserved, and many are still used as homes, inns, or local shops.\n\nHere, historic preservation in Colombia is more than a rule\u2014it\u2019s part of daily life. You\u2019ll feel it in every step.\n\nTop Architectural Landmarks in Colombia\n\n1. Walled City of Cartagena\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site, this historic district is filled with colonial homes, balconies, cobblestone streets, and vibrant colors\u2014all surrounded by centuries-old stone walls.\n\nType: Historic\n\nHistoric Style: Colonial\n\n2.

        "full_text": "Neither Lee Zeldin, nor Elon Musk, nor President Trump could possibly look Brian Kelly in the eye to tell him to his face that he is lazy.\n\nThey cannot tell Kayla Butler she is crooked.\n\nThey dare not accuse Luis Antonio Flores or Colin Kramer of lollygagging on the golf course.\n\nIf Zeldin, Musk, or Trump knew a scintilla about them, they would dare not froth at the mouth with their toxic stereotypes about federal civil servants. All four work in Region 5 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), responsible for pollution monitoring, cleanups, community engagement, and emergency hazardous waste response for Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\n\nThe Midwest is historically so saturated with manufacturing that just those six states generated a quarter of the nation\u2019s hazardous waste back in the 1970s, and it is still today home to a quarter of the nation\u2019s facilities reporting to the EPA\u2019s Toxic Release Inventory Program. When I recently visited Region 5\u2019s main office in Chicago, one enforcement officer, who did not give her name because of the sensitivity of her job, told me there are still toxic sites where \u201cwe show up [and] neither the state nor the EPA has ever been [there] to check.\u201d\n\nWith irony, I visited the office the same week the Trump administration and Zeldin, President Trump\u2019s new EPA administrator, announced they planned to cut 65% of the agency\u2019s budget. Zeldin has since then dropped even more bombshells in a brazen attempt to gut the nation\u2019s first line of defense against the poisoning of people, the polluting of the environment, and the proliferation of global warming gases.\n\nZeldin announced on March 12th more than 30 actions he plans to undertake to weaken or cripple air, water, wastewater, and chemical standards, including eliminating the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights and getting the EPA out of the business of curbing the carbon dioxide and methane gases fueling global warming. Despite record production that has the United States atop the world for oil, Zeldin said he was throttling down on regulations because they are \u201cthrottling the oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nLast week, the New York Times reported the EPA is considering firing half to three-quarters of its scientists (770 to 1,155 out of 1,540) and closing the Office of Research and Development, the agency\u2019s scientific research office. Zeldin justifies this in part by deriding many EPA programs as \u201cleft-wing ideological projects.\u201d He violently brags that he is \u201cdriving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.\u201d\n\nImpact of cuts at EPA felt deeply, broadly\n\nKelly, Butler, Flores, Kramer, and many others I talked with in Region 5 said all these plans are actually a bayonet ripping out the heart and soul of their mission. They all spoke to me on the condition that they were talking as members of their union, Local 704 of the American Federation of Government Employees. Nicole Cantello, union president and an EPA attorney, said the attacks on her members are unlike anything she\u2019s seen in her more than 30 years with the agency. As much as prior conservative administrations may have criticized the agency, there\u2019s never been one\u2014until now\u2014that tried to \u201cfire everybody.\u201d\n\nFlores, a chemist who analyzes air, water, and soil samples for everything from lead to PCBs, said a decimated EPA means less scrutiny for another Flint water crisis, less eyeballs on Superfund sites, and limited ability to investigate toxic contamination after train derailments, such as the incident two years ago in East Palestine, Ohio. He added, \u201cAnd we have a Great Lakes research vessel that tests the water across all the lakes. It\u2019s important for drinking water, tourism, and fishing. If we get crippled, all that goes into question.\u201d\n\nButler is a community involvement coordinator who works through Superfund legislation to inform communities about remediation efforts. She was deeply concerned that urban neighborhoods and rural communities will be denied the scientific resources to tell the full story of environmental injustice. Superfund sites, the legacy of toxic chemicals used in manufacturing, military operations, mining and landfills, are so poisonous, they can have cumulative, compound effects on affected communities, triggering many diseases. A 2023 EPA Inspector General report said the agency needed stronger policies, guidance, and performance measures to \u201cassess and address cumulative impacts and disproportionate health effects on overburdened communities.\u201d\n\nButler is deeply concerned cumulative impact assessments will not happen with cuts to the EPA, denying urban neighborhoods and rural communities the scientific resources to fully expose the horror of environmental injustice. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear story that they\u2019re trying to erase.\u201d Butler said of the new administration.\n\nFor Kelly, an on-site emergency coordinator based out of Michigan, the rollbacks and the erasing of the story of environmental harms have an obvious conclusion. \u201cPeople will die,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be additional deaths if we roll back these protections.\u201d\n\nWhat these workers also fear is the slow death of spirit amongst themselves to be civil servants.\n\nStart with Kelly.\n\nI actually talked to him from Chicago by telephone because he was out in Los Angeles County, deployed to assist with the cleanup of the devastating Eaton Fire that killed 17 people and destroyed more than 9,400 structures.\n\nBetween the Eaton Fire and the Palisades Fire, which took another 12 lives and destroyed another 6,800 buildings, the EPA conducted what it said was the largest wildfire hazardous materials cleanup in the history of the agency, and likely the most voluminous lithium battery removal in world history\u2014primarily from the electric and hybrid vehicles and home battery storage people were forced to leave behind as they fled.\n\nDuring a break, Kelly talked about how nimble he and his colleagues must be. He has worked cleanups of monster storms Katrina, Sandy, and Maria, and the East Palestine trail derailment. Based normally out of Michigan, he recalled a day he was working in the Upper Peninsula on a cleanup of an old abandoned mine processing site. He received a call from a state environmental emergency official asking him to drop what he was doing because 20 minutes away a gasoline tanker truck had flipped over, spilling about 6,000 gallons of gasoline onto the roads and down through the storm sewer into local waterways.\n\nWhen he arrived, Kelly asked the fire chief how he could help. He was asked to set up air monitoring. But then he noticed anxious contractors who were wondering if they were going to get paid for their work. \u201cThey\u2019re ordering supplies, they\u2019re putting dirt down to contain this gasoline from getting any further,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBut they\u2019re like, \u2018Are we going to get paid for this?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI found the truck driver who was talking to their insurance company. So I get on the phone with the insurance company and say, \u2018Hey. This is who I am. This is what\u2019s happening here. You need to come to terms and conditions with these contractors right now or EPA\u2019s going to have to start taking this cleanup over!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe insurance was covered. Kelly said he could not have been so assertive with the insurance company without a robust EPA behind him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be able go out and respond to these emergencies, but you have to have attorneys on your side,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have enforcement specialists behind you. You\u2019ve got to have people who are experts in drinking water and air. You can\u2019t just have one person out there on an island by themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cCruel for the sake of being cruel\u201d\n\nButler wonders if whole communities will become remote islands, surrounded by rising tides of pollution. The very morning of our interview, she was informed she was one of the thousands of federal workers across the nation who had their government purchase cards frozen by Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest human and President Trump\u2019s destroyer of federal agencies. In launching the freeze, Musk claimed with no evidence, \u201cA lot of shady expenditures happening.\u201d\n\nButler threw shade on that, saying the purchase system is virtually foolproof with multiple layers of vetting and proof of purchase. She uses her purchase card to buy ads and place public notices in newspapers to keep communities informed about remediation of Superfund sites.\n\nShe has also used her card to piece together equipment to fit in a van for a mobile air monitor. The monitor assists with compliance, enforcement, and giving communities a read on possible toxic emissions and dust from nearby industrial operations.\n\n\u201cI literally bought the nuts and bolts that feed into this van that allow the scientists to measure all the chemicals, all the air pollution,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI remember seeing the van for the first time after I bought so many things for years. And I was like \u2018Wow this is real!\u2019\u201d\n\nNot only was the van real, but air monitoring in general, along with soil monitoring\u2014 particularly in places like heavily polluted Southeast Chicago\u2014has been a critical tool of environmental justice to get rid of mountains of petcoke dust and detect neurotoxic manganese dust in the air and lead in backyards.\n\n\u201cAir monitoring created so much momentum for the community and community members to say, \u2018this is what we need,\u2019\u201d Butler said.\n\nKramer is a chemist in quality assurance, working with project planners to devise the most accurate ways of testing for toxic materials, such as for cleanups of sites covered in PFAS\u2014aka \u2018forever chemicals\u2019\u2014from fire retardants, or at old industrial sites saturated with PCBs from churning out electrical equipment, insulation, paints, plastics, or adhesives. His job is mostly behind the scenes, but he understood the meaning of his work from one visit to a site to audit the procedures of the Illinois EPA.\n\nThe site had a small local museum dedicated to the Native tribes that first occupied the land. \u201cThe curator or director told us how the sampling work was going to bring native insects back to the area and different wildlife back to the streams,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cIt was kind of a quick offhand conversation, but it gave me a quick snapshot of the work that\u2019s being done.\u201d\n\nKramer wonders how many more scientists will follow in his footsteps to see that the work keeps getting done. He remembered a painful day recently when a directive came down that he could not talk to contractors, even those who happen to work in the same building as he does.\n\n\u201cI see them every day,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThey come say hi to me. They know my child\u2019s name. Being told that I couldn\u2019t respond if they came to my desk, looked me in the face, and said, \u2018good morning,\u2019 is just such an unnecessary wrench into our system that just feels cruel for the sake of being cruel.\u201d\n\nStaff stifled, heartbroken\n\nThe culture of fear is particularly stifling for one staffer who did not want to give her name because she is a liaison to elected officials. Before Zeldin took over, she would get an email from an elected official asking if funding for a project was still on track and \u201c30 seconds later,\u201d as she said, the question would be answered.\n\nHer job \u201cis all about relationships,\u201d keeping officials informed about projects. Now, she said just about everything she depends on to do her job has basically come to a halt. \u201cEveryone\u2019s afraid to say anything, answer emails, put anything in writing without getting approval. Just mass chaos all the way to the top.\u201d\n\nRelationships are being upset left and right according to other staffers. One set of my interviews was with three EPA community health workers who feel they are betraying the communities they serve because their contact with them has fluctuated in the first months of the Trump administration. They\u2019ve had to shift from silence to delicately dancing around any conversation that mentions environmental justice or diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nThey did not want to be named because they did not want to jeopardize the opportunity to still find ways to serve communities historically dumped on with toxic pollution for decades because of racism and classism.\n\n\u201cLiterally since January 20, my entire division has been on edge,\u201d said one of the three. \u201cWe kind of feel like we\u2019re in the hot seat. A lot of people working on climate are afraid. If you\u2019re working with [people with] lower to moderate income or [places] more populated by people of color, you\u2019re afraid because you don\u2019t want to send off any flags to the administration.\u201d\n\nThe tiptoeing is heartbreaking to them because they see firsthand the poisoning of families from chemicals the EPA has regulated. One of the health workers has painful memories of seeing the \u201cdevastated\u201d look on mothers\u2019 faces when giving them the results of child lead tests that were well above the hazardous limit. \u201cI feel like I made a promise to them that I would be there for what they needed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel like I\u2019ve been forced to go back on that promise.\u201d\n\nRemembering their mission boosts morale\n\nDespite that, and despite President Trump\u2019s baseless ranting, which included saying during the campaign that \u201ccrooked\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d federal workers were \u201cdestroying this country,\u201d these EPA staffers are far from caving in. Nationally, current and former EPA staff last week published an open letter to the nation that said, \u201cWe cannot stand by and allow\u201d the assault on environmental justice programs.\n\nLocally in Region 5, the workers\u2019 union has been trying to keep morale from tanking with town halls, trivia nights, lunch learning sessions, and happy hours. In a day of quiet defiance, many of the 1,000 staffers wore stickers in support of the probationary employees that said, \u201cDon\u2019t Fire New Hires.\u201d Several of the people I interviewed said that if Zeldin and the Trump administration really cared about waste and inefficiency, they would not try to fire tens of thousands of probationary workers across the federal system.\n\nOne of them noted how the onboarding process, just to begin her probationary year, took five months. \u201cIt wastes all this money onboarding them and then eliminating them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s totally abusing taxpayer dollars if you ask me. It\u2019s hard enough to get people to work here. We\u2019re powered by smart people who went to school for a long time and could make a lot of money elsewhere.\u201d Federal staffers with advanced degrees make 29% less, on average, than counterparts in the private sector, according to a report last year from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nIndividually, several said they maintained their morale by remembering why they came to the EPA in the first place. Flores, whose public service was embedded into him growing up in a military family, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make the next shampoo,\u201d with his chemistry degrees. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a better adhesive for a box\u2026the tangible mission of human health and environmental health is very important me.\u201d\n\nThe enforcement officer who wanted to remain anonymous talked about a case where she worked with the state to monitor lead in a fenceline community near a toxic industry. Several children were discovered to have elevated levels of lead in their blood.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019 lives are in my hands,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we realized how dire the circumstance was, we were able to really speed up our process by working with the company, working with the state and getting a settlement done quick. And now all those fixes are in place. The lead monitoring has returned back to safe levels, and we know that there aren\u2019t going to be any more kids impacted by this facility.\u201d\n\nOne of the community health workers I interviewed said her mission means so much to her because at nine years old she lost her mother to breast cancer after exposure to the solvent trichloroethylene (TCE). That carcinogen is used in home, furniture, and automotive cleaning products. The Biden administration banned TCE in its final weeks, but the Trump administration has delayed implementation.\n\n\u201cThe loss of her rippled throughout our community,\u201d the worker said of her mother. \u201cShe was active in our church, teaching immigrants in our city how to read. The loss of her had such a large impact.\u201d She said if the EPA were gutted, so many people like her mother would be lost too soon. \u201cWe play critical roles beyond just laws and regulations,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do serve vital functions for communities based on where the need is the most.\u201d\n\nThe same worker worried that if an agency as critical to community health as the EPA can be slashed to a shell of itself, there is no telling what is in store next for the nation. \u201cI know people don\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for bureaucrats,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think what is happening to us is a precursor to what happens to the rest of the country. We\u2019re supposed to be this nonpartisan force that\u2019s working for the American people, and attacks to that is a direct attack on the American people.\u201d\n\nOne of her co-workers seconded her by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for the American people and we are the American people. We all began this job for a reason. We all have our \u2018why.\u2019 And that hasn\u2019t changed just because the administration has changed, because there\u2019s some backlash or people coming after us. Just grounding yourself with people whose \u2018why\u2019 is the same as yours helps a lot.\u201d",

        "full_text": "Vengeance is mine, sayeth Donald J Trump! And, it is so!\n\nIf there were ever doubts about the power of the presidency, they\u2019ve been settled by the election of Donald J Trump as the 47th president of the US. It is truly astonishing what Trump has wrought in the first 80 days of his second administration \u2013 although \u201creign\u201d might be a more appropriate word. At least, he would like to think so.\n\nIn less than 100 days, Trump\u2019s managed to divide the \u201cfree world\u201d against itself, discriminately rip apart pieces of the federal government that offend him, shift the budgets of NATO nations from butter to guns, lay claim to countries that don\u2019t belong to him \u2013 asking them to give up their sovereignty (or else).\n\nWait, it\u2019s not the whole story. The US is now engaged in tariff wars with our closest allies, causing the markets to drop as a warning of a possible recession and for no other reason than to please the president.\n\n\u201cWe are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetime because of President [Donald] Trump\u2019s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\u201d\u00b7 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\n\nWhims are not the only \u201cpromises made, promises kept\u201d of the 47th president \u2013 or as he likes to think \u2013 in the reign of Donald the First. I don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019s agreed to become part of the British Commonwealth, believing he can become the next \u2013 dare I say \u2013 king of England. (Charles, watch your backside.)\n\nChaos is the currency of this administration \u2013 hoping that once they restore order, people will forget who created the problems in the first place. It\u2019s a tried-and-true formula. It\u2019s especially true when you have command of the military, a willing and dysfunctional legislature, and control of the courts.\n\nTrump has managed two of those three truths in less than 100 days. Now, his gambit is to take over the courts \u2013 but not just the courts. He\u2019s making moves on the legal profession, hoping to prevent defendants from finding legal representation. As well, he and his cabal are looking to remove and replace judges whose decisions don\u2019t comport with Trump\u2019s opinion of himself.\n\nFollowing Judge Boasberg\u2019s order to stop deportations under the 200-year-old Alien Enemies Act (AEA), Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department would consider taking action against Boasberg.\n\nBorder Czar Tom Homan, who\u2019s yet to be confirmed, said: I don\u2019t care what judges think. Trump\u2019s call to impeach Judge Boasberg was ominous enough to cause Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Roberts to question the president\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cFor more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\u201d\u00b7 Chief Justice John Roberts\n\nSecretary of Defense Hegseth, whose qualifications for the position include being a FOX News contributor and unabashed Trump loyalist, ordered the separation of all transgender military personnel from the services. The reason was his unfounded opinion that only heterosexuals are fit to defend the nation and democracy. He believes the same of LGBTQ+ members of the military.\n\nAs often happens, a federal judge had a different opinion of the situation. According to US District Court Judge Ana Reye:\n\n\u201cThe Military Ban is soaked in animus and dripping with pretext. Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact.\u201d\n\nJudge Reye\u2019s words perfectly describe the forces driving the second Trump administration during its first 100 days. The Trump whirlwind is a political blitzkrieg against friends and foes alike.\n\nThe chaos and frenzy of these first days of the Trump 2.0 have seemingly sucked the air out of the congressional Democrats and traditional conservative Republicans. Appeasement, rather than opposition, is the watchword of these early days. Members of Congress are hardly alone in their reaction. Universities, corporations, and the leaders of other nations have followed suit.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand how the president and his minions are accomplishing their objectives. It\u2019s through extortion and fear. The might of the US is not to be trifled with when Donald Trump\u2019s in charge.\n\nOf all the many threats to the democratic order, I see Trump\u2019s executive orders directed at private sector law firms and the capitulation of one of the most largest law offices in the world \u2013 Paul, Weiss \u2013 as perhaps the most ominous.\n\nAs reported, Trump \u201cissued an executive order that suspended the firm\u2019s lawyers from holding security clearances, terminated any of its federal government contracts, and prevented its employees from entering federal government buildings on national security grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of law firms that we\u2019re going to be going after because they were very dishonest people.\u201d\u00b7 Donald J Trump\n\nThe firm capitulated rather than fight the order, promising to provide the White House with $40 million in pro bono legal services on issues dear to the president.\n\nTrump\u2019s attack on Paul, Weiss came just days after a federal judge in Washington \u201cruled that the nearly identical order against Perkins Coie was likely unconstitutional and issued a temporary restraining order blocking it from taking effect.\u201d\n\nFollowing his victory over Paul, Weiss, the president has gotten more aggressive in his efforts to undermine the judicial system. In a recent executive order, Trump stated:\n\n\u201cI hereby direct the Attorney General to seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising Trump is trying to limit the involvement of the courts in his business. However, impeachment of judges is a real long shot. Even if the House voted to impeach, the Senate would be very unlikely to agree.\n\n\u201cThe first thing we do is, let\u2019s kill all the lawyers.\u201d\u00b7 Dick the Butcher\n\nA second, and perhaps the better plan, is to go after the lawyers. He\u2019s doing it by giving the attorney general license to make an example of somebodies. Who defines what\u2019s frivolous and when?\n\nIt\u2019s the US Attorney General chosen for her loyalty to the president \u2013 some say rather than the US Constitution \u2014 that\u2019s who. There\u2019s nothing subtle in the message or the means.\n\nAttempt to stop me and I\u2019ll throw the might of the federal government after you.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, the Trump administration already faces over 100 lawsuits. Every time a new executive is issued, lawyers start lining up at the courthouse doors.\n\nAsk yourselves this. If one of the largest, wealthiest, and best politically connected firms, with some of the brightest lawyers, couldn\u2019t withstand the attack, what chance do average lawyers representing progressive causes have? It\u2019s a question whose answer involves careful thought and preparation \u2013 ahead of time.\n\nIf all of this, by which I mean Trump 2.0, weren\u2019t chilling enough for climate and other progressive causes weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s the recent decision by a North Dakota jury that Greenpeace must pay $666 million and change \u201cto a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline.\u201d\n\nThe company, Energy Transfer, claimed defamation of character, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy, and other acts. (I wonder if the jury knew the biblical significance of the number 666?) The decision in the Greenpeace case is going to encourage fossil fuel companies to file similar suits in other states.\n\nThe moral of this story is not to stop being activists. There\u2019s already enough passivity on Capitol Hill. The message is straightforward \u2014 be careful because the administration could come after you from many directions. So, be prepared.\n\nStrategize ahead of time about your vulnerabilities and do something about them. If you\u2019re hiring attorneys, consider how vulnerable they might be to Trumpian pressures.\n\nTwo Republican administrations have attacked me, so I speak from experience. And I learned two things from my encounters. First, being ultimately vindicated can be both expensive and of little consolation.\n\nSecond, and far more critical today, appeasing a bully only encourages the bully. You have to stand up to them. You might lose, but it\u2019s the only chance of winning.\n\nTeaser image credit: The Condemnation of Saint Lawrence by the emperor Valerian (Fra Angelico, c. 1450).

        "full_text": "THE DEMAND FOR electricity in Ireland is expected to rise by 45% in the next decade, according to EirGrid.\n\nData centres and and any other new technology-related energy drains are forecast to account for 31% of electricity demand by 2034.\n\nEirGrid has published its annual analysis of Ireland\u2019s electricity landscape. The new report examines the likely balance between electricity demand and supply over the 10-year period from 2025 to 2034 for the whole island of Ireland.\n\nEirGrid has been warning policymakers about an increasing tightness between supply and demand since 2016.\n\nOver the next few years, there is a \u201cpotentially challenging outlook\u201d in Ireland, EirGrid says.\n\nDemand for electricity is forecast to grow considerably over the next decade. Under the median scenario, electricity demand would increase by 45% between 2023 and 2034.\n\nIn this scenario, the peak demand is forecast to increase by 24% by 2034 compared with 2023.\n\nIreland recorded a new peak demand of 6,024 MW on 8 January 2025, which was the first time that peak electricity demand surpassed 6,000 MW. By 2034, EirGrid\u2019s analysis anticipates that it will be above 7,000 MW.\n\nAs the world battles the climate crisis, Ireland and other countries need to switch from fossil fuels and transition their grids to renewable sources of energy.\n\nUnder the Climate Action Plan, Ireland should be sourcing 80% of electricity from renewables like wind and solar by 2030.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe imperative to lower greenhouse gas emissions that are clogging up the atmosphere and causing global average temperatures to rise is ever-clearer as scientific report after scientific report shows the tangible impacts of climate change.\n\nData centres\n\nData centres will make up a significant chunk of the rising demand.\n\nLast year, The Journal Investigates uncovered that data centres using backup and emergency generators in Ireland are releasing huge quantities of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nOver 135,000 tonnes of CO2 was emitted from these centres in the last five years from generators not on the electricity grid. The backup generators are used to keep the centres operational during times of grid connectivity issues.\n\nThe investigation also highlighted how some planned data centres intend to be powered by natural gas because they cannot be connected to the grid as it is under such strain.\n\nElectrification\n\nIt\u2019s expected that the electrification of heat and transport will also contribute to the rising electricity demand.\n\nThe proportion of overall electricity demand from heat pumps is estimated to rise from 3% in 2025 to 10% by 2034.\n\nAdditionally, the proportion of overall demand from electric cars will likely rise from 1% to 8%.\n\nA media statement from EirGrid says that its analysis \u201cshows that further new electricity generation will be required to secure the transition to high levels of renewable electricity over the coming decades\u201d.\n\n\u201cA balanced portfolio of new capacity is required, including the need for new cleaner gas fired generation which is renewable gas ready and can supply electricity at times when the wind and solar generation is low.\u201d\n\nEoin Kennedy, Director of Innovation and Planning at EirGrid said that \u201cas we transition to a renewable-led transmission system, which will benefit the economy and wider society, the electricity industry will have to find new ways to meet the increasing need for energy without relying mainly on burning fossil fuels\u201d.\n\n\u201cNew government policies will help to guide this transition as electricity demand increases out to 2030,\u201d Kennedy said.",

Read our privacy policy\n\nEarlier this month, Kmart pulled a \u201chyaluronic acid cleansing balm\u201d from its shelves, after a teen who used the skincare product was hospitalised, reporting eye pain and blurred vision. It\u2019s unclear what ingredient caused this reaction.\n\nIn a statement, Kmart said it was removing the product while conducting an investigation. The retailer also said: \u201cWe want to assure our customers that our cosmetics are designed to ensure that they comply with both Australian and European requirements on ingredients.\u201d\n\nHyaluronic acid \u2013 despite the name \u2013 is a gentle ingredient commonly used in skincare products.\n\nBut what does hyaluronic acid do to your skin as a skincare ingredient? And is it safe for tweens and teens?\n\nHyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan \u2013 a sugar-based molecule found naturally in the skin, eyes, joint fluid and connective tissue.\n\nopen image in gallery Hyaluronic acid holds the key to smooth, flawless and hydrated skin ( Getty )\n\nIt plays a key role in hydrating the skin and tissues, lubricating our joints and supporting tissue repair.\n\nBeyond cosmetics, hyaluronic acid is used in drug delivery, regenerative medicine, wound repair, and to treat conditions such as atherosclerosis (where the arterial walls harden and narrow) and osteoarthritis (a degenerative joint disease).\n\nIt is also a key ingredient in many eye drops and contact lens care solutions.\n\nWhile the word \u201cacid\u201d might suggest it is harsh and potentially damaging to the skin, hyaluronic acid is not used in its acidic form in skincare products. It is usually used in its salt form, sodium hyaluronate.\n\nIn skincare, active acids such as salicylic acid usually lower the skin\u2019s pH and exfoliate it by breaking the bonds between dead skin cells.\n\nHyaluronic acid, in contrast, is used to hydrate the skin. It is a humectant, an ingredient that attracts and retains water molecules.\n\nHyaluronic acid has three qualities that make it suitable for skincare: it\u2019s soluble (can be dissolved in water), biocompatible (meaning it\u2019s not harmful to the body), and biodegradable (naturally breaks down into non-toxic, simpler substances).\n\nIt is usually safe and well-tolerated, meaning it has very few side effects.\n\nIn skincare products, hyaluronic is used in different forms. Smaller hyaluronic molecules can penetrate deeper into the skin and hydrate the lower levels. In products this is often advertised as \u201canti-ageing\u201d, because it stimulates the production of collagen (a structural protein in the skin), and helps to improve elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines.\n\nLarger hyaluronic acid molecules remain on the skin\u2019s surface and have an immediate hydrating effect, preventing water evaporation from the skin.\n\nHyaluronic acid is generally a safe ingredient, even for sensitive skin. But products advertised as \u201chyaluronic acid skincare\u201d may contain other ingredients which can cause irritation.\n\nIn particular, fragrances, preservatives and surfactants (ingredients that produce foam and help wash away oil and dirt) may be safe for skin but burn or otherwise irritate the eyes.\n\nThis is because the cornea and conjuctiva (the thin membrane covering the eye) are much more sensitive than the skin.\n\nUnlike medicines and products used for therapeutic reasons, which are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), general cosmetic products do not require pre-market safety testing or approval.\n\nInstead, companies need to register their business with the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme and verify that their ingredients are not banned or restricted in Australia.\n\nThis creates a potential gap where defective products remain on the market, only to be recalled after adverse reactions occur.\n\nMost scientific research on active ingredients \u2013 including hyaluronic acid \u2013 has been evaluated in older populations. This leaves a gap in understanding how they affect teen and preteen skin.\n\nMany products are designed for ageing and/or specific skin types, and are largely unnecessary for children and younger people.\n\nIn some cases, they can potentially be harmful to their skin. For example, unless prescribed by a dermatologist, it\u2019s advisable for young people to avoid retinoid products (containing retinol or retinal) as they can cause redness, peeling and drying.\n\nSimilarly, products with alpha hydroxy acids can cause irritation, itching, redness and may worsen acne in young skin.\n\nPreteens and teens should avoid products containing active ingredients such as retinol, vitamin C, alpha- and beta- hydroxy acids, and peptides, as well as those labelled with terms such as anti-ageing, wrinkle-reducing, brightening, or firming.\n\nTo keep skin clean and protected, teenagers can use a good cleanser, a simple moisturiser and a broad spectrum SPF 30 or 50 sunscreen.\n\nIt\u2019s best to opt for gentle, fragrance-free cleansers and moisturisers suitable for all skin types. Consulting with a pharmacist can provide personalised recommendations based on individual skin needs.\n\nZoe Porter is a lecturer in Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science at the Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.

Any peace deal that fails to consider these land policies will be a contradiction in terms.\n\nThe weaponry used in the Russia-Ukraine war has been modern, but land remains the conflict\u2019s most valuable strategic asset. And for Russia, the main value in land is not economic but political. Far from merely occupying Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin is quietly but efficiently converting military occupation into permanent ownership and global influence through land and agricultural policy.\n\nThe weaponry used in the Russia-Ukraine war has been modern, but land remains the conflict\u2019s most valuable strategic asset. And for Russia, the main value in land is not economic but political. Far from merely occupying Ukrainian territory, the Kremlin is quietly but efficiently converting military occupation into permanent ownership and global influence through land and agricultural policy.\n\nEven as the conflict\u2019s stipulated borders and peacekeeping mechanisms dominate the public discussion, the fate of any peace deal could turn on its treatment of the physical land that Russia occupies and the grain and other crops it produces there. Any peace deal that fails to consider these land policies will be a contradiction in terms.\n\nLand has always been crucial for politics, and control over it remains a fundamental strategy in winning any conventional war. Land confers immense economic, political, and social power to those who control it. Because land is central to livelihoods in the rural areas of eastern and southern Ukraine, and because the country\u2019s fertile chernozem (black earth) is highly valuable for agricultural production, who holds that land\u2014and how they hold it\u2014determines who has political power.\n\nRussia has accordingly sought to dominate and rewire occupied Ukraine through its imposition of Russian law and administration over the land. In the occupied territories, Russian authorities are forcing people off their land, stripping them of their ability to resist the occupation, and requiring others to reregister their land in Russian land registries\u2014with the threat of losing it if they fail to comply.\n\nFor the residents of occupied Ukraine, the choice is stark: Compliance means acceptance of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule, whereas defiance might lead to financial ruin. Those who have left the region and become refugees might lose their property forever.\n\nThese policies also follow a time-tested playbook. States have long used land to strip their enemies of power and to assert new control and authority. From the Roman lex agraria to the Ottoman Land Code of 1858 to Venezuela\u2019s 2001 Land Law, the requirement to reregister land can be used as an opportunity for land grabbing in an atmosphere of legal limbo. Throughout history, occupiers have used land ownership to repress or remove dissident populations, bring in loyalists, and assert control.\n\nThis is also a familiar Russian strategy of dominating Ukraine, having been employed at times ranging from Russia\u2019s imperial expansion during the 18th century to the heydays of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s collectivization, famine, and mass deportations in the 1930s-1940s.\n\nWhile Ukrainians are being pushed out, Russians are moving in. In the rapidly expanding land grab, Russian oligarchs and agricultural companies close to the Kremlin have already taken over large tracts of occupied cropland, according to the Wall Street Journal. Residents of occupied Ukraine estimate that tens of thousands of Russian citizens have already moved to these territories, lured by prospects of cheap or free real estate that formerly belonged to Ukrainians who have been killed or displaced by the Kremlin.\n\nThe implications of Russia\u2019s land policies in occupied Ukraine will shape the future of the region\u2014and potentially the world. Any cease-fire that stops the fighting but fails to address the Kremlin\u2019s land grab will make it impossible to describe Ukraine\u2019s territory as merely \u201coccupied\u201d by Russia. Allowing Russia to control, register, and reallocate land as it pleases will eventually make the area into a de facto fully Russian territory.\n\nThe Kremlin is also using its control of Ukrainian land to advance Russia\u2019s global influence. In the global south, Moscow\u2019s standing is strong, allowing it to circumvent sanctions, obtain foreign soldiers, gain diplomatic support, and continue the war in Ukraine. That standing turns on Russia\u2019s control of land and its use of that land for influence in the global grain market.\n\nWhile the United States and its allies have spent considerable effort to curtail Russia\u2019s geopolitical leverage through controls on its exports of oil and gas, Western policymakers consistently ignore Russia\u2019s even more potent tool of global influence\u2014bread.\n\nRussia has only recently gained dominance on the global grain market. Traditionally, the Soviet Union was a major importer of grain. Both it and the Russian Empire before it were brought down by food shortages, and as late as 1999, Russia had to rely on Western food aid to feed itself.\n\nThis changed in mid-2000s, when the Kremlin adopted a long-term strategy to make agriculture a priority in order to shield Russia from dependence on imported food. In less than 15 years, Russia switched from being an importer of wheat to the world\u2019s largest exporter; it now controls about a quarter of global wheat trade.\n\nHistorically, for Russia\u2019s leaders, food is a weapon. Starting in the 1920s, famines in which millions perished were used by Soviet authorities to destroy and subjugate dissident social groups and regions.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and the country\u2019s current deputy secretary of the Security Council, explicitly refers to grain as Russia\u2019s \u201csilent but fearsome\u201d ammunition, suggesting it could be used against countries opposed to the Kremlin\u2019s war. Russian state media has also threatened to stop food supplies to \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries.\n\nIn October 2024, Russia even proposed the creation of a grain exchange among the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and several recently added members) in what Nikkei referred to as a possible \u201cOPEC for wheat,\u201d in which Russia would be an undisputed leader.\n\nThe war against Ukraine has only strengthened Russia\u2019s grip over the global grain supply. Whereas the West managed to limit the Kremlin\u2019s ability to use oil and gas as geopolitical weapons, Russian agriculture and agricultural exports have largely been shielded from sanctions in an effort to avoid disruptions to global food supplies.\n\nSince February 2022, Russia\u2019s wheat exports have risen significantly, increasing by 24 percent from 2022-23 to 2023-24. In the Middle East and North Africa, regions that are heavily dependent on grain imports for food security and stability, reliance on Russian grain only deepened after the Kremlin\u2019s 2022 invasion.\n\nThis increase is not simply a result of Russia producing more. Russia\u2019s growing global share and expanding exports in the grain industry are a direct outcome of its devastation of Ukraine, another major agricultural producer, and its seizure of Ukrainian grain. Arrangements that encourage Ukraine\u2019s own exports are simply not sufficient to compensate for the wreckage caused by the war.\n\nThe implications of Russia\u2019s quest for dominance through grain are profound. In 2010, Russia\u2019s position on the global grain market was much more modest, with 15 percent of the global export share. But when a drought prompted it to ban grain exports that year, many Middle Eastern and North African countries struggled to compensate for the lost grain, and the subsequent food crisis contributed to the outbreak of the Arab Spring.\n\nNow, Putin is doing it again: After the fall of the Kremlin-allied regime of Bashar al-Assad, Russia quickly suspended grain shipments to Syria, contributing to an economic crisis. If Russia continues to cut grain exports for geopolitical reasons or because of domestic shortages, the fallout could be a global wave of instability, food insecurity, and migration.\n\nThe West therefore should recognize the dangers and the long-term impact of Russia\u2019s land policies in occupied Ukraine and act accordingly. Otherwise, even if Ukraine manages to liberate its territories sometime in the future, it will have to confront a new structure of land ownership, deals, and land transfers that have been carried out outside of Ukraine\u2019s legal and administrative framework\u2014and the conflicting ownership claims that will result.\n\nExperience from other conflicts shows that such situations often result in an overloaded legal system, economic inefficiency, political resentment, and potentially large-scale violence. After years of war and devastation, the Ukrainian government simply will not have enough capacity to meet this challenge on its own.\n\nAny future cease-fire agreement should thus prevent Russia from unilaterally changing land ownership policies in occupied Ukraine. The United States and European Union should not lift sanctions or normalize relations with the Kremlin while it continues to grab Ukrainian land. Ukraine\u2019s partners and international bodies such as the World Bank should also work with Kyiv to monitor land ownership structures in the occupied areas and prepare the legal and administrative tools to mitigate the impact of Russia\u2019s land policies if these regions return to Ukraine.\n\nIt will also be important to use every available instrument to counter Russia\u2019s ability to unleash a global food security crisis for political benefit. This could involve punishing anyone who illegally benefits from the illicit trade in grain from occupied Ukraine.\n\nBut policymakers should also promote and subsidize alternatives to Russian grain\u2014including in Ukraine itself. That will be the only way to prevent Russia\u2019s use of Ukrainian land as a weapon against the world.",

        "full_text": "Imagine a technology that could facilitate an unprecedented expansion of totalitarian power in the hands of the ECB and EU Commission. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIf you are a citizen of one of the Euro Area\u2019s 20 member nations and are wondering why the legacy media is suddenly awash with articles on the European Central Bank\u2019s proposed digital euro after studiously ignoring its development over the past six years, there is a simple reason: the digital euro is closer than ever to becoming a reality \u2014 at least according to own architects.\n\nIn fact, the two main EU institutions driving its development, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission, are, if anything, determined to accelerate its roll out. Which kind of makes you wonder: why all the rush?\n\nWith the \u201cpreparation phase\u201d of the digital euro scheduled to end in October and since the European Central Bank and the European Commission need the European Parliament, the EU\u2019s rubber stamping chamber legislative assembly, to approve the definitive legal framework for the bloc\u2019s proposed central bank digital currency, or CBDC, the time has finally come to sell the project to the people \u2014 with the help, of course, of the legacy media and news agencies.\n\nHowever, it is not easy to sell a project that is broadly seen, even by many politicians and some central bank insiders around the world, not only as a \u201csolution in search of a problem\u201d but one that is fraught with risks. Even the German MEP appointed to lead the European Parliament\u2019s legislative push for a digital euro, the Rapporteur Stefan Berger, become one of its fiercest critics, eventually stepping down from the role.\n\nAccording to the German financial journalist Norbert H\u00e4ring, the only identifiable function of the digital euro is to \u201chelp displace cash and bring Europe closer to total digital surveillance.\u201d So, how do you sell a project whose advocates (in the words of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller) \u201coften fail to ask a simple question: What problem would a CBDC solve?\u201d\n\nThe answer, it seems, at least in the case of the Euro Area, is to generate as much fear as possible about Europe\u2019s dependence on US payments providers at a time when the US is increasingly viewed as hostile to Europe. Lagarde says that the digital euro is necessary in order to preserve Europe\u2019s monetary sovereignty \u2014 oh, the irony. Last week, the European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane warned about the risks of Europe\u2019s outsized dependence on American payment providers leaving it open to future economic coercion. From Reuters:\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s reliance on foreign payment providers has reached striking levels,\u201d Lane said in a speech in Cork, Ireland. \u201cThis dependence exposes Europe to risks of economic pressure and coercion and has implications for our strategic autonomy, limiting our ability to control critical aspects of our financial infrastructure.\u201d \u201cWe are witnessing a global shift towards a more multipolar monetary system, with payments systems and currencies increasingly wielded as instruments of geopolitical influence,\u201d he said. He warned that national card schemes have been entirely replaced by international alternatives in 13 of the euro zone\u2019s 20 countries, making it imperative that the ECB pushed ahead with issuing a digital currency. \u201cThe digital euro is a promising solution to counter these risks and ensure the euro area retains control over its financial future,\u201d Lane said.[1]\n\nAnd here comes the first big lie from the Reuters piece:\n\nA digital euro would function much like cash, allowing people to make direct retail payments without relying on a card service provider.\n\nThis could not be further from the truth (as we will explain in point #2 below), but it sure sounds reassuring to EU citizens who continue to trust the word of the media on matters of great import. And there are few matters more important than the system of money we live and work under.\n\nAs we warned back in 2022, the mass development and rollout of central bank digital currencies would represent (and this, I believe, is not hyperbole) a financial revolution that threatens to radically reconfigure the very nature of money itself. And let\u2019s be clear: this will not be a bottom-up revolution. There are no European citizens marching in the streets calling for a digital euro, for the simple reason that most people already believe they are using a digital euro currency every time they pull out their card or mobile phone.\n\nBut there are some key differences between the ECB\u2019s proposed digital euro, and the digital euro currency currently in use. For a start, the former will be money issued by the state, via the central bank (though it will still be commercial banks that manage all the customer-facing activities) and users will be allowed to hold a maximum deposit of 3,000 euros at any one time [2]. The latter, meanwhile, is private money issued and managed by commercial banks.\n\nAs the use of cash has declined, in part because of the war waged upon it by the EU Commission and the ECB, the amount of public money in the economy has also declined. Now, the ECB and Commission want to reverse this dynamic by issuing their own CBDC. But this will have potentially far-reaching implications that should give all EU citizens pause. Here are five of the most important reasons why we should be terrified of the fast approaching launch of the ECB\u2019s digital euro:\n\n1. The Digital Euro Could (And Almost Certainly Will) Be Used As a Tool of Financial Surveillance and Control.\n\nA central bank digital currency system will technically no longer require middlemen such as banks or credit card companies. That said, Europe\u2019s largest financial institutions, many of which have been helping to build the architecture for the CBDC system, will find a new role in the new digital reality. This probably explains why the ECB is so keen on further consolidation in Europe\u2019s banking sector: once the digital euro is firmly established, there will be even less need for choice and competition within the banking sector.\n\nAs the ECB noted in a press release last December, \u201cSupervised intermediaries, such as banks, would play a key role in distributing the digital euro. They would act as the main point of contact for individuals, merchants and businesses for all digital euro-related issues and would perform all end-user services.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the ECB, like all central banks that end up launching a CBDC, will retain oversight and control over the creation, destruction, and movement of money, just as Agustin Carstens, general manager of the Bank of International Settlements, put it at a 2020 summit of the IMF:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s using a $100 bill today and we don\u2019t know who\u2019s using a 1,000 peso bill today. The key difference with the CBDC is the central bank will have absolute control [over] the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability, and also we will have the technology to enforce that.\u201d\n\nIt is not just the prospect of the ECB and the Commission being able to track, trace and monitor all of our financial activity \u2014 what we earn, how we spend, what we save \u2014 that should terrify us; it is also the prospect of them being able to \u201cprogram\u201d money so as to achieve certain monetary, fiscal or social policy objectives.\n\nIn a fully cashless digital-euro system, the central bank and Commission would have a complete record of every transaction made by everyone, allowing it to essentially eradicate tax evasion. The potential applications go far beyond that, notes NS Lyons, a Washington DC-based consultant and analyst in his 2022 article CBDC Caution: A Central-Bank-Issued Digital Dollar Could Enable a Dark Future:\n\nFines, such as for speeding or jaywalking, could be levied in real time, if CBDC accounts were connected to a network of \u201csmart city\u201d surveillance. Nor would there be any need to mail out stimulus checks, tax refunds, or other benefits, such as universal basic income payments. Such money could just be deposited directly into accounts. But a CBDC would allow government to operate at much higher resolution than that if it wished. Targeted microfinance grants, added straight to the accounts of those people and businesses considered especially deserving, would be a relatively simple proposition.\n\nOther potential forms of programming applications include setting expiry dates for stimulus funds or welfare payments to encourage users to spend it quickly in order to boost economic activity. It would be a central banker\u2019s wet dream. Programmable money could also be used to encourage the right sorts of consumption and discourage or even prevent the wrong sorts. Taken to the extreme, governments could use CBDCs to exclude the deplorables and undesirables from the economy altogether.\n\nAs independent media outlets like this one have shone an ever brighter spotlight on the potential dangers of programmable money, the ECB has shifted its stance, claiming now that it will not use programmable money. But at the same time it has relabelled programmable money as \u201cconditional payments\u201d and appears to have given the job of programming these payments to the payment service providers who will be managing all customer-facing activities.\n\nAs Lyons warns, CBDCs, \u201cif not deliberately and carefully constrained in advance by law,\u2026 have the potential to become even more than a technocratic central planner\u2019s dream. They could represent the single greatest expansion of totalitarian power in history.\u201d Imagine that power in the hands of the likes of Ursula von der Leyen and Christine Lagarde!\n\n2. It Will Probably Accelerate the Demise of Cash\u2026 and By Extension, Financial Privacy.\n\nThe ECB, like the EU Commission, insists that a central bank-issued digital euro will co-exist alongside cash for many years, if not decades, to come. As we\u2019ve noted in previous articles, cash, while in gradual decline in the EU, is still widely supported and used in many member states, particularly Germany and Austria. Also, as the near-cashless nirvanas of Scandinavia are discovering, cash offers payment systems greater resilience, particularly in times of war and rising cyber theft.\n\nHowever, will cash enjoy a level-playing field with a digital euro? It\u2019s unlikely.\n\nBoth the ECB and the Commission spearheaded Europe\u2019s War on Cash from around 2011, going so far as to impose cash caps of 1,000 euros in Italy and 500 euros in Greece during its flirtation with Grexit. Although the ECB appears to have undergone a change of heart in recent years, even going so far as to introduce a 2023 directive aimed at protecting the right to use cash in retail settings the EU, it is impossible to know whether this is genuine or merely a position of convenience given cash\u2019s ongoing popularity among many European publics and the intended roll out of a direct competitor in the form of the digital euro.\n\nECB president Christine Lagarde is anything but cash friendly. Also, banks, arguably the biggest enemies of cash, have been broadly excluded from any EU legislation aimed at preserving cash.\n\nMy guess is that once introduced, a digital euro will gradually confer more and more financial perks and benefits to those who use it. This is exactly what the Bank of Nigeria did in 2022 when it launched the eNaira, the world\u2019s first CBDC of a largeish economy. And when that didn\u2019t work it switched from carrot to stick, even going so far as to remove over half of all the cash notes used in the economy, causing a sharp recession. Yet even that didn\u2019t work, and by September last year Nigerians were using more cash than before while the eNaira continued to founder.\n\nPresumably, the EU has learnt from these embarrassing failures, and European governments (with the obvious exception of Austria) will continue with their death-by-a-thousand-cuts assassination of cash. If the ECB, EU Commission and national EU member governments were to accelerate cash\u2019s demise by penalizing its use (while incentivizing the use of CBDCs), we would witness the loss of one of the last vestiges of financial freedom, privacy and anonymity.\n\nThe ECB and its national member banks insist that a digital euro will help to protect financial privacy, but if you believe that, I\u2019ve got a digital bridge to sell you. Even the ECB itself has repeatedly stated that the financial privacy offered by a digital euro will be strictly limited. From Ledger Insights:\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there will be two versions of the digital euro. The offline version aims to be as close to cash as possible and is designed for smaller payments. Online payments are closer to typical card or bank payments today\u2026 The recent European elections show that future national governments could be very different from our current ones. Given Europe\u2019s World War II history, it\u2019s not a stretch to ponder what might happen in a less benevolent world. What if the digital euro has real traction and cash is barely used? How easy would it be to change the digital euro system to break the privacy protections currently being carefully crafted? For the offline digital euro, transactions would remain private, but preventing people from topping up their wallets would be easy. In the case of the online digital euro case, a law change and a relatively small change in data access would probably suffice to undermine the privacy design completely. Designing a CBDC to account for every future unpleasant scenario is likely impossible for central banks. Dooms Day scenarios aside, the ECB is making a concerted attempt to protect privacy.\n\nThat may be true today but will it be true tomorrow? This brings us to the third reason why European citizens should be terrified of a digital euro\u2026\n\n3. The EU\u2019s Word Cannot Be Trusted.\n\nThe EU institutions are constantly breaking even their own rules and regulations. Witness the way the Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has run roughshod over the EU\u2019s transparency and accountability rules in the Pfizergate scandal without facing any consequences. Or the way the Digital Services Act contravenes the EU\u2019s own laws on freedom of expression and information, including Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nOr indeed the way the Commission has essentially carried out a coup in Romania to prevent a politician who is opposed to project Ukraine from gaining power, and is now secretly interfering in the Polish election campaign, using taxpayers\u2019 money and instruments developed by the military and intelligence services, according to the German journalist Norbert H\u00e4ring.\n\nWhat this should all tell us is that any pledges by the ECB and the Commission to safeguard cash, to respect financial privacy, and to not use programmable money applications once the digital euro is live are essentially worthless. The EU can change the rules of the game whenever it wants and however it wants, as it has been doing since its inception.\n\nAnd that prospect should terrify EU citizens given that the driving mission of the EU is to accrue to itself more and more centralised power and control over Europe\u2019s citizenry, businesses, societies and economies. As Brussels has consolidated power over the EU economy, the performance of that economy has been underwhelming, particularly since the self-inflicted energy crunch caused by the 16 rounds of sanctions the EU has (so far) imposed on Russia. Which brings us to the next point\u2026\n\n4. The EU Needs Your Money\u2026\n\n\u2026to fund its remilitarisation. And taxpayer funds and further expansions of public debt alone will not be enough to finance its ambitions. Indeed, the EU\u2019s plan to borrow \u20ac800 billion for defence was rejected by the Dutch Parliament. Just a few days ago, the European Commission announced the launch of yet another union, the \u201cSavings and Investment Union\u201d, aimed at channelling trillions of euros of European savings into the coffers of a new generation of innovative European companies \u2014 primarily, of course, in the arms business. From Euronews:\n\nThe European Commission unveiled on Monday a plan to better channel up to \u20ac10 trillion in bank deposits across the bloc into much-needed strategic investments. \u201cCurrently, too few European citizens make a decent return on their hard-earned savings, at least not in a simple and cost-efficient way,\u201d EU Commissioner for Financial Services Maria Luis Albuquerque told reporters in Brussels. \u201cThis is regrettable and represents a loss to us all,\u201d she added.\n\nIn other times of widespread war, European and North American governments have been able to raise funds by selling war bonds to the citizenry. But that has tended to work only when the government of the day and its war effort enjoy a minimal level of popularity. That is unlikely to be the case with the EU\u2019s attempts to keep project Ukraine alive. So, instead, Brussels is seeking to rewrite its own regulations, primarily aimed at protecting investors, in order to make it easier for investment funds to invest in arms manufacturers, including in securitised assets.\n\nThis plan appears to have been in the pipeline for some time. Just over a year ago, France\u2019s Minister for the Economy Bruno Le Maire declared that Europe does not have sufficient funds and needs to \u201cmobilize all of Europeans\u2019 savings \u2013 35 trillion euros \u2013 to finance the climate transition, fund our defence efforts, and invest in artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nUnreal. This is Bruno Le Maire, France's Minister of the Economy. You might know him as the genius strategist who said he was going to \"cause the collapse of the Russian economy\"\u2026 Now he is straight out declaring that Europe has run out of money (it \"does not have sufficient\u2026 https://t.co/fra7DeEoCE \u2014 Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) February 23, 2024\n\nThe fact that an increasingly militarised EU is openly coveting its citizens vast savings pool and is willing to significantly water down investment protections in order to get it should also set off alarm bells wrt its digital euro plans. If the ECB and EU Commission are able to successfully launch a digital euro (still a big \u201cIF\u201d since no G20 central bank has managed to pull it off), they will have far greater control over our funds. And to gain easier access to those funds, all they would need to do is rewrite the rules.\n\n5. The Digital Euro Will Go Hand in Hand With the Digital Identity Wallet.\n\nMost EU citizens are probably blissfully unaware that the EU launched its digital identity legislation last year, and that by 2026 all be required to offer at least one EU Digital Identity Wallet to all citizens, residents, and businesses. As the FT reported back in 2021, CBDCs will almost certainly have to go hand in hand with digital IDs:\n\n\u201cWhat CBDC research and experimentation appears to be showing is that it will be nigh on impossible to issue such currencies outside of a comprehensive national digital ID management system. Meaning: CBDCs will likely be tied to personal accounts that include personal data, credit history and other forms of relevant information.\u201d\n\nCombining digital currencies with digital IDs while phasing out, or even banning, the use of cash would grant governments and central banks the ability not only to track every purchase we make but also to determine what we can and cannot spend our money on. They could also be used to strongly encourage \u201cdesirable\u201d social and political behaviour while penalizing those who do not toe the line. Imagine that power in the hands of Eurocrats like Von der Leyen!\n\nThe positive news is that the future success of the ECB\u2019s digital euro depends primarily on the citizenry. As happened in Nigeria, we will have the choice as to whether to accept it or not, as notes the German independent media outlet Multipolar:\n\n[W]hen the exclusive characteristics of cash and the consequences of its replacement come into public awareness, citizens can make a conscious decision at the checkout whether to pay digitally and thus work towards the disappearance of cash, or whether to use notes and coins and thus contribute to future generations being able to take advantage of the properties of cash.\n\nThose properties include \u201cthe freedom to hold taxed income in one\u2019s own hands,\u2026 anonymity when paying, the ability to transact in the event of technical failures, and better control over one\u2019s own spending, promotion of a disciplined approach to money even for children, inclusion of people with visual impairments, Down\u2019s syndrome and other disabilities, the possibility of earning money independently without first opening a bank account, and escape from the fees of the financial industry.\u201d\n\n[1] It is hardly surprising that the ECB is using this argument as its prime justification for accelerating the launch of the digital euro. For a start, anti-Trump feeling is strong both among EU politicians and the broader European public right now. Also, the argument is nothing new. In fact, the most commonly cited justification for launching CBDCs going all the way back to 2019 is as a means of countering the risks posed by so-called \u201cstablecoins\u201d like Meta\u2019s proposed Libra coin.\n\n[2] This 3,000 euro holding limit is considered low enough to mitigate the risk of deposit flight from commercial bank deposits to the CBDC accounts leading to a dangerous outflow of capital from the commercial banking system, resulting ultimately in bank runs and collapses. The last thing the world\u2019s central banks want to do is disintermediate large private banks, whose interests they tend to serve above all else.\n\nIn fact, central banks have been working hand-in-glove with many TBTF lenders (JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, BNP Paribas, BBVA\u2026) to set up and road test the CBDC infrastructure. If any financial institutions are going to be \u201cdisintermediated\u201d, it will probably be small, local banks and credit unions, which will not be able to cope with the added layers of regulatory costs, burdens and complexities.\n\nAccording to a December 2023 report commissioned by the European Banking Association, a holding limit at 3,000 euro could realistically lead to an outflow of up to 739 billion euro of bank deposits in the euro area \u2014 equivalent to a loss of 10% of the total household deposit base and 3% of the total bank liabilities. And it is smaller banks that will feel the most pain:",

        "full_text": "The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has this week debuted its first post-quantum cyber security standard, designed to guarantee the protection of critical data and communications in the quantum-enabled future.\n\nResponding to the potentially existential threat to current encryption methods posed by large-scale quantum computers \u2013 which will likely be able to efficiently solve the complex maths relied on by current asymmetric public key cryptography (PKC) \u2013 ETSI has developed specification TS 104 105 \u2013 or, to give it its full name, Efficient quantum-safe hybrid key exchanges with hidden access policies \u2013 to help ensure that only authorised users are able to access sensitive data.\n\nThe standard defines a scheme for Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) with Access Control (Kemac) \u2013 dubbed Covercrypt \u2013 that ETSI claims will ensure pre- and post-quantum security through hybridisation.\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, it will lock and anonymise session keys based on user attributes, and enables those who meet the encapsulation policy requirements to retrieve them while keeping those who don\u2019t away.\n\nETSI said its standard also heralded a breakthrough in efficiency \u2013 it takes a few hundred microseconds to encapsulate and decapsulate said keys. It can supposedly be easily and readily integrated into existing security products, the body added.\n\n\u201cETSI\u2019s latest specification marks a significant milestone in the transition to post-quantum cryptography,\u201d said Matt Campagna, chair of the Quantum Safe Cryptography (QSC) working group at ETSI. \u201cThis standard is fundamental to the quantum future, we are empowering organisations to safeguard their sensitive data both for today, and for the decades ahead.\n\n\u201cThe work we\u2019ve done in the Cyber QSC working group underlines our commitment to providing secure, future-proof solutions that can withstand emerging threats, while also helping to build a healthy industrial ecosystem and a sustainable economy,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more about post-quantum security Scepticism over quantum still abounds, but for cyber professionals it brings both unprecedented capabilities and significant threats, demanding careful attention.\n\nNIST has launched the first three quantum-resistant encryption algorithms \u2013 organisations are encouraged to adopt them as soon as they can.\n\nTests carried out at Finnish telecom operator Telia will support the building of a secure quantum network.\n\nETSI said organisations should begin to use quantum-resistant encryption as soon as possible to future-proof their data security, safeguard their most sensitive data and remain compliant with yet-to-emerge standards.\n\nThe launch of the standard comes in the wake of guidance issued by the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, which similarly urged organisations to begin exploring their migration pathways to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).\n\nThe NCSC\u2019s advice \u2013 which can be accessed in full here \u2013 sets out a three-phase schedule that will help key industries move to quantum-resistant encryption over the next decade.\n\nThe agency said that at-risk organisations \u2013 such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, operators of critical national infrastructure and public sector organisations \u2013 should have the core of a migration plan in place by 2028, before beginning high-priority upgrades and then moving on to a complete PQC migration by 2035.\n\nThe NCSC said much of this work involved the sort of activity that would accompany any large-scale IT migration, and in security terms, activity that should already be at the heart of any business\u2019 security practice \u2013 so those that are sufficiently on the ball should think about using PQC migration as an opportunity to build additional resilience into their IT systems.\n\nThe agency also noted that the ultimate cost of PQC migration could be significant, so it is essential that organisations begin to budget accordingly.",

        "full_text": "Once a climate champion, Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is pushing for more oil drilling, even as the country prepares to host the UN climate conference.\n\nWhen President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in early 2023, environmentalists breathed a sigh of relief. After four years of environmental destruction under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, the new leader arrived on a pledge to protect the climate.\n\nFast forward two years, and that relief has turned to disappointment. Just months before Brazil is due to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), Lula is pushing for oil exploration at the mouth of the Amazon River, and his government has approved joining the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+).\n\n\"The world has given Brazil a mandate to lead the climate debate in 2025,\" said Claudio Angelo, coordinator of communications at Brazilian nonprofit Observatorio do Clima. \"To double down on oil expansion is a betrayal of that mandate.\"\n\nIs Brazil doubling down on its oil industry?\n\nBrazil has vast reserves of oil and ranks as the eighth-largest global exporter \u2014 behind such countries as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. But the government is looking to increase its oil share and move up into fourth place.\n\n\"We should not be ashamed of being oil producers,\" said Brazil's energy minister, Alexandre Silveira, upon announcing the country's plans to join OPEC+. \"Brazil needs to grow, develop and create income and jobs.\"\n\nOPEC brings together major oil-producing countries, including Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, to coordinate the production of oil and maintain a stable market. Other significant producers, the largest of which is Russia, are not full members, but agree to cooperate with nations as part of OPEC+.\n\nSpeaking to reporters during a recent press briefing, Andre Correa do Lago, president-designate of the upcoming COP30 climate summit, said joining OPEC+ gives Brazil the chance to be involved in conversations on transitioning away from oil.\n\nThough Brazil will not be a full member of OPEC, environmentalists have criticized the move, arguing that it cements the country's oil ambitions for the future.\n\nLula has argued, however, that oil revenues are needed to help finance a green energy transition.\n\nCorrea do Lago reiterated this line, saying it is easier and cheaper to borrow money to invest in oil projects than in other more sustainable ones.\n\nThe money \"you gain from exploring oil can be used internally for projects that are good for the [clean energy] transition,\" he said.\n\nIs Brazil embracing renewables?\n\nIlan Zugman, Latin American managing director of environmental campaign organization 350.org, rejects the government's argument. He says there is currently no national policy for a further move to renewables and that even if there were, money for such a transition could be funneled from other sources.\n\n\"Brazil every year gives billions and billions of dollars to subsidize the fossil fuel industry...we'd like to see Brazil shifting some of these subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables,\" he told DW.\n\nAccording to a report from the nonprofit scientific and technological institution INESC P&D Brazil, federal subsidies for the production and consumption of oil, gas and coal reached around $14.56 billion (\u20ac13.3 billion) in 2022. That's five times more than is invested in renewables.\n\n\"The money is there; it is just not being put in the right places,\" said Zugman. \"And of course, we're still missing the political will, the courage to make some bold decisions and start shifting these resources to an energy that can improve our situation of carbon emissions in the world.\"\n\nIs President Lula really a climate leader?\n\nBrazil is the world's sixth biggest greenhouse gas emitter, with deforestation and changing land use within the Amazon region accounting for a majority of the country's emissions. The Amazon is the world's largest tropical rainforest and a significant carbon sink.\n\nFollowing his 2022 electoral victory, Lula promised to rein in the illegal logging, mining and land clearing for activities like cattle ranches and soybean farms that had become commonplace under his predecessor.\n\nIn the first six months of Lula's tenure, deforestation fell by around a third and has continued to decrease. The president pledged to end tree felling in the Amazon by the end of the decade.\n\nThe country's bid to host the COP30 summit in the Amazon city of Belem was seen as further evidence of the government's commitment to climate. So too, Brazil's timely submission of its latest climate goals, which are required by signatories of the Paris climate accord. The agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).\n\nBrazil's targets promise an emissions cut of between 59% and 67% over 2005 levels by 2035.\n\n\"That's frankly not that ambitious,\" Angelo of Observatorio do Clima said. \"It's nowhere near compatible with 1.5 [degrees].\"\n\nThe goals also do not include any targets on oil exports, the burning of which doesn't count towards Brazil's emissions, but will have an impact globally.\n\nResearchers from SEEG, a major greenhouse gas monitoring platform in Latin America, say that if Brazil were to exploit projected reserves, the emissions from their burning would cancel out the savings made through reducing Amazon deforestation.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are felt in Brazil\n\nBrazil is facing some of the most devastating consequences of climate change. In the last year alone, the country experienced its worst drought on record and wildfires ravaged an area of around 30.86 million hectares in 2024, an area larger than Italy.\n\nWorld Weather Attribution, a collective of scientists investigating the connection between extreme weather and global heating, found human-driven climate change made wildfires that burned through the Pantanal wetland in June 2024 at least four times more likely and 40% more intense.\n\n\"People [in Brazil] are literally feeling the heat,\" said Angelo. \"This is not lost to the presidency. They know what is at stake. But right now the mix of domestic and geopolitical issues is making the agenda very cloudy.\"\n\n\n\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker",

        "full_text": "Are you looking for a home style that feels both classic and fresh? Modern Mediterranean homes might be perfect for you.\n\nThese houses take the best parts of classic Mediterranean buildings and mix them with today\u2019s clean design ideas.\n\nIn this blog, we\u2019ll examine what makes these homes special, from their white walls and curved doorways to their natural materials and open layouts.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at each room and show how to add this style throughout your house.\n\nWhether you\u2019re building new, fixing up an old home, or just adding a few touches, this guide will help you create a Modern Mediterranean home that fits your lifestyle.\n\nWhat is a Modern Mediterranean Home?\n\nA Modern Mediterranean home combines the classic feel of Mediterranean design with current style preferences.\n\nThis mix keeps the warmth and character of homes found along the Mediterranean Sea while adding clean, simple elements that work well today.\n\nPeople love this style in warmer states like California, Texas, and Florida because it fits perfectly with sunny weather and outdoor living.\n\nThe light colors and open spaces make these homes feel comfortable and relaxing while still looking fresh and current.\n\nModern Mediterranean Interior Design Elements\n\nThe inside of a Modern Mediterranean home should match its exterior in feeling and style. Here are the main elements that create this look indoors.\n\nNatural Materials (Wood, Stone, Clay)\n\nModern Mediterranean homes use materials that improve with age. Oak and walnut floors add warmth and texture.\n\nStone counters cool spaces, while clay pots hold plants or stand as art. These materials often stay natural or get simple treatments that protect their best qualities.\n\nEarthy and Neutral Color Palette\n\nThe colors in these homes are calm and simple. White or cream walls brighten rooms and highlight other elements.\n\nNature inspires the added colors\u2014browns, tans, and soft greens. Blue appears as a sea-inspired accent. Black iron or dark wood creates contrast points that add depth.\n\nClean Lines with Rustic Touches\n\nThis style mixes new and old elements. Furniture shapes remain simple, while rustic pieces add warmth\u2014think rough wooden tables or handmade lamps.\n\nThis balance prevents spaces from feeling too perfect or too basic. Choose straight-lined furniture with natural finishes and simple fixtures made from quality materials.\n\nLayered Textures and Soft Fabrics\n\nTexture brings comfort to these homes. Linen curtains, cotton rugs with subtle patterns, and wool throws create a casual yet polished look.\n\nNatural fibers with minimal shine add tactile appeal. These soft elements balance the harder stone and plaster surfaces that define the Mediterranean style.\n\nSteel Windows and Doors\n\nMetal-framed openings are essential in these homes. Their thin profiles hold large glass panels, creating strong visual lines against white walls.\n\nSteel frames allow nearly seamless indoor-outdoor connections. Black aluminum or fiberglass can create a similar effect for budget options.\n\nRoom-by-Room Inspiration: Modern Mediterranean Home\n\nLiving Room\n\nModern Mediterranean living rooms focus on comfort and gathering. Wooden beams running across the ceiling add warmth and a sense of history.\n\nCurved walls or arched doorways soften the space and guide movement between rooms. Layered rugs create comfort underfoot while adding subtle patterns and color.\n\nFurniture tends to be low and simple, often arranged for conversation rather than facing a TV. Natural light is key, with large windows that might open fully to connect to outdoor space.\n\nKeep the overall look simple, but add a few quality pieces that show craftsmanship.\n\nKitchen\n\nThe heart of a Modern Mediterranean kitchen is often a statement range hood\u2014perhaps made of plaster, metal, or stone.\n\nThis focal point rises above simple cabinets, often in white or natural wood. Natural stone appears on counters or as a backsplash, bringing in subtle patterns.\n\nOpen shelving displays everyday items like pottery, glassware, and cooking oils in simple glass bottles.\n\nThese kitchens aim to be both useful and beautiful. They often include space for shared meals and might open directly to outdoor dining areas.\n\nFresh herbs growing in clay pots add life and practicality.\n\nBathroom\n\nModern Mediterranean bathrooms feel like personal spas. For a seamless look, walls might be finished in water-resistant plaster or concrete.\n\nBronze or brass fixtures add warmth and will look even better as they develop a natural patina over time.\n\nA freestanding tub often serves as the main focus, perhaps placed near a window with a good view. Shower areas may be open or enclosed with simple glass.\n\nFloors and accent walls might feature handmade tiles in simple patterns. These spaces balance cleanliness with warmth \u2013 they feel fresh but not cold.\n\nBedroom\n\nThe Modern Mediterranean bedroom serves as a calm retreat. Linen bedding in white or soft earth tones creates a relaxed, lived-in look that\u2019s still clean.\n\nWarm lighting comes from simple wall sconces or bedside lamps with ceramic or metal bases. The room stays free of clutter, with just a few needed items kept in view.\n\nFurniture is often minimal \u2013 perhaps just a bed with a simple headboard, small bedside tables, and a bench or chair.\n\nNatural air flow matters here and windows should be placed to catch breezes when possible. The overall feel should be cool and calming, perfect for rest.\n\nOutdoor Areas\n\nOutdoor spaces are just as important as indoor rooms in Modern Mediterranean homes.\n\nCourtyards offer private outdoor areas, often centered around a small fountain or fire pit. Patios extend living space with comfortable seating for both dining and lounging.\n\nPergolas covered with climbing vines create natural shade that shifts throughout the day. Plants are chosen for their beauty and low water needs\u2014think olive trees, lavender, and rosemary.\n\nLighting matters, too, with simple string lights or lanterns that create a magical feel after dark. These spaces become extra living rooms for much of the year.\n\nKey Features of Modern Mediterranean Architecture\n\n1. Stucco Walls and White Exteriors\n\nStucco walls define Modern Mediterranean homes with their smooth or slightly textured surface that looks solid and lasting.\n\nOften painted white or cream, these walls reflect heat in warm climates and create a clean backdrop for plants.\n\nThe surface may include small details that create interesting shadows.\n\n2. Red Tile or Flat Rooflines\n\nModern Mediterranean homes feature either traditional clay tile roofs in red or terracotta tones or sleek, flat rooflines with clean edges.\n\nBoth styles work well in sunny areas and help keep homes cool. Gentle roof slopes sometimes extend to create useful shade around the house.\n\n3. Arched Windows and Doorways\n\nCurved shapes stand out in these homes. Arched windows and doors add soft lines that balance the straight edges elsewhere.\n\nThese might be bold half-circles or gentle curves that let in light and frame outdoor views. Modern versions often use arches selectively to keep the look fresh.\n\n4. Metal or Wood Accents (Beams, Railings)\n\nNatural materials bring warmth to Modern Mediterranean homes. Wooden beams might cross ceilings, while iron railings create strong dark lines against white walls.\n\nThese elements connect to historical roots while maintaining a clean look. Small metal details in windows, handles, and furniture continue this theme.\n\n5. Indoor-Outdoor Living Spaces\n\nThese homes seamlessly blend interior and exterior spaces. Large sliding doors, covered patios, and consistent flooring make moving between areas easy.\n\nCourtyards, pergolas, and terraces function as year-round living spaces. Plants like vines, citrus trees, and herbs add life to these areas.\n\nHow to Modernize a Traditional Mediterranean Home\n\nUpdating a traditional Mediterranean house requires finding the right balance between old and new.\n\nStart by removing overly fancy details, such as heavily carved wood, ornate ironwork, or dated tile patterns, that make spaces feel old-fashioned.\n\nReplace dark wood cabinets with lighter versions or paint them white while keeping their quality construction.\n\nChoose new materials that honor the home\u2019s roots while looking fresh \u2013 perhaps concrete counters instead of busy tile or simple linen curtains instead of heavy drapes.\n\nAdd modern lighting with clean shapes to brighten rooms and create focal points.\n\nThroughout the process, focus on keeping the good bones and natural charm while making the home better suited to today\u2019s living needs.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\n\nUsing too many dark brown furnishings that make spaces feel heavy and gloomy\n\nMixing in beach-themed items that confuse the look and feel unauthentic\n\nChoosing materials that require too much upkeep or don\u2019t last in your climate\n\nCreating beautiful spaces that don\u2019t work well for daily family activities\n\nAdding too many small decorative items creates visual clutter\n\nIs a Modern Mediterranean Home Right for You?\n\nThis style works best in areas with mild, sunny weather, similar to the Mediterranean region.\n\nIt is perfect for California, Florida, Texas, Arizona, and other warm states, but it can also be adapted for other places.\n\nModern Mediterranean homes are great for families who need durable materials and easy-to-clean surfaces, as well as people who like to host friends and family since the layout supports good flow between spaces.\n\nNature lovers appreciate how these homes connect to outdoor areas and use natural materials.\n\nBudget-wise, be ready to invest in quality materials like stone, good windows, and solid wood.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nModern Mediterranean homes bring together the best of two worlds \u2013 old-world comfort and contemporary simplicity.\n\nThey work well in warm areas but can fit in many places with some changes.\n\nIf you love this style, start small by adding natural materials, neutral colors, and a few key curved shapes to your current home.\n\nTry painting a wall white, adding a wooden beam, or using linen curtains. Focus on creating spaces that feel good and work well for your daily life.\n\nWith some thought and care, you can create a Modern Mediterranean home that feels both fresh and timeless\u2014a place where you\u2019ll want to spend time for years to come.",

Michigan and Weiss face a class-action lawsuit arising from Weiss\u2019s alleged misbehavior.\n\nVia NBC News, two women (a former Michigan gymnast and a former Michigan soccer player) have sued the school for failure to supervise and monitor Weiss.\n\nTheir lawsuit alleges that Weiss and the other parties (including Keffer Development Services, which managed confidential information) violated the plaintiffs\u2019 Title IX protections, their civil rights, and civil laws arising from legal standards including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\n\u201cThe recklessness and negligence and misconduct of the Regents, the University, and Keffer in these respects enabled Weiss to target female college athletes to obtain their private and sensitive information without authorization, including but not limited to Plaintiffs,\u201d the civil complaint alleges.\n\nWeiss allegedly began to access personal and intimate photographs and videos from female athletes in 2015. Prosecutors allege that Weiss accessed information regarding more than 150,000 athletes.\n\nWeiss was a graduate assistant at Stanford when Jim Harbaugh arrived as the head coach in 2007. After two years with Jim Harbaugh, Weiss took a job as the assistant to Ravens head coach John Harbaugh. Weiss then moved through a variety of positions through 2020.\n\nHe rejoined Jim Harbaugh, at Michigan, in 2021 as the team\u2019s quarterbacks coach. In 2022, Weiss served as co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He was abruptly fired in January 2023 following a university investigation of computer access crimes.\n\nNeither the Ravens nor the Chargers (where Jim Harbaugh now works) responded to requests for comment from PFT. Although the alleged behavior was unrelated to Weiss\u2019s Ravens employment, he absolutely would have been subject to league scrutiny and discipline under the Personal Conduct Policy \u2014 if he had been working for an NFL team when these allegations came to light.",

(NYSE: LODE) (\u201cComstock,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and the \u201cCompany\u201d), today announced the timely completion of two successful settlements of prior outstanding strategic commitments.

With the metals segment achieving full operational status and remarkable, real-time revenue growth and the fuels segment securing multiple commercial, operational and jurisdictional support agreements, and direct strategic investments, both businesses remain focused on driving continued revenue generation and expanding their globally relevant network of supply chain partners.\n\nAbout Comstock Inc.\n\nComstock Inc.

        "full_text": "America\u2019s military budget is more than just numbers on a page\u2014it\u2019s a reflection of the priorities that shape our society. Right now, that nearly trillion dollar budget is bloated, inefficient, and far removed from the needs of everyday Americans. We\u2019ve identified six simple yet effective ways to cut at least $100 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s budget\u2014without sacrificing even the most hawkish of war hawk\u2019s sense of national security. Ready to take the scissors to that excess spending? Here\u2019s how we can do it.\n\n1. Halt the F-35 Program (Save $12B+ per year)\n\nThe F-35 is the poster child for military mismanagement. It\u2019s a fighter jet that was supposed to revolutionize our military\u2014except it\u2019s plagued by cost overruns, delays, and underperformance. Despite a projected lifetime cost of over $2 trillion, this aircraft only meets mission requirements about 30% of the time. If we ended or paused the F-35 program now, we\u2019d free up $12 billion annually. The military-industrial complex can afford a few less fancy jets that destroy land and lives, especially when they don\u2019t even do their job right.\n\n2. Reassess Long-Range Missile Defense (Save $9.3B+ per year)\n\nFor over half a century, we\u2019ve sunk an eye-watering $400 billion into long-range missile defense systems that have never delivered. The cold, hard truth is these systems are ineffective against real-world threats. In fact, no missile defense technology has ever proven capable of neutralizing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) attack. Cutting back on these programs would save us $9.3 billion per year\u2014money that could be better spent on diplomacy initiatives that actually work.\n\n3. Cut the Sentinel ICBM Program (Save $3.7B+ per year)\n\nICBMs were once the crown jewels of our nuclear deterrence strategy, but they\u2019re outdated in today\u2019s geopolitical climate. With more reliable and flexible platforms like submarines, bombers, and emerging hypersonic technologies, maintaining an expensive, high-risk ICBM arsenal makes little sense. Ending the Sentinel ICBM program would save taxpayers $3.7 billion annually, and even more in the long run, with total savings over its lifespan estimated at $310 billion. It\u2019s time to face facts: we don\u2019t need to keep pouring money into a strategy that no longer aligns with modern defense needs. Especially when the best nuclear deterrence system is ending nuclear weapons programs to begin with.\n\n4. Cease Procurement of Aircraft Carriers (Save $2.3B+ per year)\n\nAircraft carriers are relics of a bygone era, costing billions to build and maintain, while becoming increasingly vulnerable to modern missile technology. These floating cities are no longer the symbols of naval power they once were. By halting new aircraft carrier procurements, we can save $2.3 billion a year\u2014money that could be better allocated to ways that actually keep us safe in the 21st century like housing, healthcare or climate justice.\n\n5. Cut Redundant Contracts by 15% (Save $26B per year)\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s bureaucracy is a cash cow for contractors\u2014more than 500,000 private sector workers are paid to do redundant and often wasteful work. Many contracts overlap or go toward projects that are, frankly, unnecessary. Cutting back just 15% on these contracts would save $26 billion annually. That\u2019s a massive chunk of change that could be reallocated to more efficient and effective defense projects. Want a starting point? Look no further than SpaceX\u2019s lucrative contracts\u2014it\u2019s time we hold these companies accountable.Maybe DOGE knows a guy there?\n\n6. Prioritize Diplomacy (Save $50B+ per year)\n\nThe best way to avoid unnecessary military spending is to prevent conflicts from happening in the first place. By focusing on diplomatic solutions instead of military interventions, we can scale back expensive overseas bases, reduce troop deployments, and use reserves and National Guard units more effectively. This shift could save up to $50 billion a year\u2014and possibly as much as $100 billion in the long term. It\u2019s about time we put our resources into creating peaceful solutions rather than preparing for endless wars.\n\nWhat Could We Do with the $100 Billion in Savings?\n\nThe possibilities are endless when we take a more practical approach to national security spending. What could we do with the $100 billion we save? Here\u2019s a snapshot of just some of the incredible investments we could make in American society:\n\n787,255 Registered Nurses: Filling critical healthcare gaps nationwide.\n\n10.39 million Public Housing Units: Making affordable housing a reality for families across the country.\n\n2.29 million Jobs at $15/hour: Providing good jobs with benefits, boosting the economy.\n\n1.03 million Elementary School Teachers: Giving our children the education they deserve.\n\n579,999 Clean Energy Jobs: Building a sustainable, green future for the next generation.\n\n7.81 million Head Start Slots: Giving young children a foundation for lifelong success.\n\n5.88 million Military Veterans receiving VA medical care: Ensuring those who served our country receive the care they earned.\n\nThe Bottom Line?\n\nCutting $100 billion from the Pentagon budget isn\u2019t just a pipe dream\u2014it\u2019s a tangible, achievable plan that could deliver real benefits to everyday Americans. While it\u2019s just a starting point, this reduction would allow us to prioritize what truly matters: healthcare, education, infrastructure, and the well-being of our people. If we\u2019re going to spend taxpayer dollars, let\u2019s make sure they go toward initiatives that directly benefit the lives of the citizens who fund them.\n\n*\n\nClick the share button below to email/forward this article.

        "full_text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's government launched fresh tax cuts on Tuesday and announced other cost-of-living relief in a major push to win back disgruntled voters, tipping the budget back into the red.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese's centre-left government is seeking to win a second term in a May election and is running neck-and-neck in the polls against the conservative Coalition opposition.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers in his fourth budget also unveiled new efforts to boost economic resilience and competitiveness, acknowledging heightened new global risks from trade wars as well as geopolitical tensions.\n\n\"This budget is really a platform for prosperity in a new world of uncertainty,\" Chalmers said in a press briefing. \"It recognises the cost of living pressures are front of mind for many Australians.\"\n\nIn keeping with the practice of recent years, most of the measures announced in the budget had already been flagged.\n\nHowever, the two new rounds of tax cuts, worth A$17.1 billion ($10.7 billion), came mostly as a surprise and build on those introduced last year.\n\nThrough cutting the lowest tax bracket, a worker on average earnings will get a new tax cut of A$268 in the fiscal year ending June 2027 and A$536 in the following fiscal year, more modest than the A$1,654 relief in the tax cuts introduced this fiscal year.\n\nThe budget also features an A$8.5 billion investment in public healthcare. It will also extend electricity rebates until the end of the year, roll out funding for public schools and cut student debt.\n\nThat will knock the underlying budget balance for the 2025 fiscal year back into the red after two years of surpluses.\n\nThe A$27.6 billion deficit is slightly worse than the government's projection of A$26.9 billion in December. Most analysts had expected an improvement in the fiscal position.\n\nDeficits are expected to widen to a total of A$179.5 billion over the forward estimates.\n\n'AUSTRALIAN EXCEPTIONALISM'\n\nThe budget also included A$3 billion in investment to support local production of green metals, A$20 million to encourage consumers to buy Australian-made goods and initiatives to boost economic competitiveness.\n\nSome of this largesse will be funded by a tax windfall from an unexpectedly tight labour market and still strong mining profits. The government now expects the jobless rate to peak lower at 4.25% and upgraded its near-term outlook for company receipts thanks to resilient commodity prices.\n\nIn his budget, Chalmers projected a robust Australian economy in the face of growing global headwinds. The economy has moved past its trough, expanding at the fastest pace in two years last quarter, while the unemployment rate stayed at a historically low 4.1%.\n\nIt estimated a modest impact from higher U.S. tariffs on Australia by 2030.\n\n\"This genuinely is a story of Australian exceptionalism in the context of global economic uncertainties,\" Chalmers said.\n\nThe increased spending and strong labour market, however, mean inflation is now expected to pop up again to 3% over the next fiscal year, the top of the central bank's target band of 2-3%, before steadying at 2.5%.\n\nThe budget provides some relief to households but does not address the stickier parts of inflation including elevated insurance and rental costs, Katrina Ell, head of Asia-Pacific Economics at Moody\u2019s Analytics said in a statement.\n\n\"Inflation remains a critical issue heading into the Federal election as non-discretionary goods and service prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels and wages haven\u2019t kept pace,\" Ell said, adding that Moody's Analytics still expects the Reserve Bank of Australia to reduce the cash rate by a further 50 basis points this year.\n\nThe RBA has warned further policy easing is not guaranteed, having just cut interest rates for the first time in over four years last month.\n\nThe RBA sees underlying inflation settling at 2.7% over the long term, above the midpoint of the target band. The market is not pricing in another full rate cut until July, while rates are only seen falling to 3.4% by the end of the year, from 4.1% currently.\n\n(Reporting by Stella Qiu; Editing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill)",

His wife, Angela Adjei-Boateng, was also arrested the following day.\n\nThe couple is under investigation for alleged financial misappropriation linked to the procurement of cyber intelligence equipment for the National Security Council.\n\nBail Granted for Other Suspects\n\nDr. Ayine disclosed that Angela Adjei-Boateng and other co-suspects had been granted bail set at GH\u00a2260 million.\n\nHowever, their release remains pending, as EOCO verifies the title deeds of properties submitted as surety.\n\nGiven Adu-Boahene\u2019s significant connections and past attempts to alter travel plans to evade arrest, the Attorney-General stressed the urgency of presenting him in court within the constitutionally mandated 48-hour detention period.\n\nAlleged Financial Misconduct and Asset Seizures\n\nThe AG alleged that Adu-Boahene and his wife orchestrated fraudulent transactions amounting to GH\u00a249 million.\n\nA significant portion of these funds \u2013 intended for acquiring cyber defense systems \u2013 was allegedly funnelled into a private company, BNC Communication Bureau Limited, which they secretly controlled.\n\nAccording to official records, on January 30, 2020 Adu-Boahene, acting as Director of National BNC, signed a contract between the Government of Ghana, the National Security Council and an Israeli firm, ISC Holdings Ltd., for the purchase of \u201cCyber Defence System Software\u201d at a cost of $7 million.\n\nA review of bank transactions reveals that:On February 6, 2020, Adu-Boahene transferred GH\u00a227.1 million from the National BNC\u2019s operations account at Fidelity Bank to his private company\u2019s account at UMB Bank, claiming it was payment for the Cyber Defense System.\n\nShortly after receiving the funds, his private company transferred GH\u00a29.54 million (US$1.75 million) to ISC Holdings Ltd., attaching a copy of the contract and an invoice to justify the transaction.\n\nOn March 18 and 30, 2020 he further transferred GH\u00a21 million and GH\u00a221 million respectively, from the National BNC\u2019s directors\u2019 account at Fidelity Bank to the same private company\u2019s account.\n\nThe Attorney-General claimed that the suspect personally withdrew 99 percent of the funds from his private company account. S\n\nome of these withdrawals, made between February and September 2020, included GH\u00a216 million, GH\u00a27.25 million, and GH\u00a21.5 million.\n\nEOCO\u2019s probe, the minister told the media, had also uncovered extensive real estate acquisitions by the couple, including multiple properties at Mayfair Estates in Accra and 27 houses in the Vertex Properties development at Oyarifa.\n\nInvestigators are also tracing assets reportedly purchased abroad.\n\nThe A-G claims that the Authorities have flagged Universal Merchant Bank, Fidelity Bank and Stanbic Bank for possible complicity in enabling suspicious financial transactions.\n\nDr. Ayine assured the public that formal charges against Adu-Boahene and his associates would be filed in the coming days.\n\n\u201cThis government remains committed to holding accountable those who misuse public funds,\u201d he stated.He also warned directors and employees of companies linked to the suspects, as well as banks, to freeze any transactions on the accounts or movement of assets or face prosecution.\n\nAdditionally, he stated that he is open to plea bargaining under the law if the suspect is willing to admit to the allegations and repay the funds allegedly stolen from the state.\n\nMeanwhile, EOCO has indicated that efforts to track additional assets linked to the suspects are ongoing.",

        "full_text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nI never thought I'd be a mom. Then, at 42 years old, my partner and I were delighted \u2014 and shocked \u2014 to discover I was pregnant. Now, at 55, I have a 13-year-old daughter. Despite my initial unpreparedness, I've realized that becoming a parent later in life has made me a much better one.\n\nI got to enjoy young life child-free and still become a parent\n\nI'm not saying all parents automatically regret what they missed when they have kids at a young age, but I know some who do \u2014 and I might have been one of them. Having my daughter in my 40s means I don't resent my daughter for things I didn't get to do.\n\nAt 24, I was the founding editor of an entertainment magazine. If I'd had a child back then, could I have pulled the countless all-nighters working that I did, or attended all the gigs and events we covered? Unlikely.\n\nMy 20s were fun but exhausting, and by the time I hit my 40s, I was ready for a new adventure. More importantly, I was more secure in who I was. That meant I didn't sweat all the small stuff I probably would have if I were younger and trying to prove I could be the \"perfect mom.\"\n\nInstead, as a mom in my 40s to a turbo toddler, I learned that a messy house could still be a happy one. A mud-covered 3-year-old wasn't naughty \u2014 just carefree. And even if my Christmas cookies looked more like Edvard Munch's Scream than a jolly snowman, baking them with my tween was a better bonding experience than not making Christmas cookies at all.\n\nSomething else that surprised me as a middle-age mom was that I became more patient, not less, when my daughter acted out.\n\nI've heard other older mothers claim the same, and it seems we're not alone. Several studies have found that older moms are less likely to yell at or punish their kids. Seemingly, life experience gives us a broader perspective. And let's be honest \u2014 part of that is that we simply have a lot less energy!\n\nOf course, I don't ignore bad behavior, but I can recognize when my daughter is just having a bad day \u2014 like I do. So, rather than yell, I talk to her about it, something I certainly wouldn't have had the patience to do in my younger years.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere are some trade-offs to being an older parent\n\nWhen I initially told people I was pregnant, the conversation often crept around to how I would manage an infant and then a lively toddler when I was edging toward 50. One (former) friend suggested I was being selfish, as I'd likely end up being a financial or emotional burden on my daughter.\n\nI'd be lying if I said I hadn't had several sleepless nights batting away imagined realities of myself as a wizened older parent, an embarrassment and health hindrance to a 20-something daughter. But that fear pushed me to prioritize my health with good lifestyle habits, regular exercise, and routine check-ups.\n\nOf course, it hasn't stopped me from occasionally being mistaken for my child's grandmother (something my daughter finds hilarious) \u2014 but I'm still fitter than I ever was in my partying 20s and 30s.\n\nStill, I worry about aging. My 80-year-old mom is thriving and there for me when I need her; my daughter might not have that same experience.\n\nOn a broader level, I also fret about the uncertain future that awaits her. With the climate crisis, the rise of AI and automated jobs, and skyrocketing property costs, I worry about whether she will be OK if I'm not around to help her handle these challenges, as so many parents of Gen Z adults currently are.\n\nYet, despite those anxieties, I know I'm better off as an older parent.\n\nThis is just my experience. I wasn't ready for motherhood in my 20s or 30s, but I'm beyond grateful I got the chance in my 40s. I have a great relationship with my daughter, and I credit my age as a big part of that.\n\nAt 55, while many parents look forward to an empty nest and doing things they couldn't when their kids were young, I can say: been there, done that, and I'm thrilled for the next chapter of this adventure with my daughter.",

It specializes in poultry production, animal feed, and related agricultural operations. The company supplies chicken products to retail, wholesale, and fast-food markets in South Africa and neighboring countries. Astral reported over $1 billion in annual revenue for 2024.\n\nThe company announced more than $1 million in losses (20 million rand) due to a March cyberattack that impacted delivery and other operations. Astral Foods quickly responded to the incident, implementing all disaster recovery protocols and preparedness plans. The company confirmed no sensitive data was compromised in the attack.\n\n\u201cOn 16 March 2025, Astral experienced a cybersecurity incident. The Group acted swiftly, implementing all disaster recovery protocols and preparedness plans. However, our Poultry Division was negatively impacted by downtime in processing and deliveries to customers. This resulted in a loss of revenue, and together with costs to catch-up a backlog in production, have impacted the Group\u2019s profits in this reporting period by approximately R20 million.\u201d reads a statement published by the company. \u201cAt the date of this announcement, all business units are operating normally following the recovery of our systems.\u201d\n\nAstral warned investors that the cyberattack-related outages would significantly reduce earnings per share for the current financial period.\n\nAt this time, no ransomware gang has taken credit for the cyber attack.\n\nMajor food producers like Dole, JBS, Sysco, and Mondelez have faced ransomware attacks, with some incidents causing multimillion-dollar losses.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini\n\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, Astral)",

        "full_text": "announced the launch of vSOC Assure. Developed in response to the growing need for robust, ongoing security assessments, vSOC Assure goes beyond traditional cyber security audits, offering a structured, year-round approach to risk identification, remediation and reduction. The innovative platform enables organisations to measure cyber risks across their entire digital environment, delivering meaningful metrics for c-suite and technical teams to improve cyber maturity.\n\n\"Cyber risk poses the greatest threat to the solvency of organisations today, but understanding how incidents could impact a business and break through their defensive barriers, or where security postures are falling short, is a huge challenge. IT teams are often stretched, while c-suite executives don't fully understand how technical misconfigurations, or a lack of certain controls, could impact their business. vSOC Assure has been developed to address these challenges, making it easier to identify, track and manage risks. The platform streamlines cyber risk assessments across an organisation's entire digital environment, while delivering action points for c-suite and technical teams to improve resilience,\" said Simon Kean, Commercial Director at Data Connect.\n\nThe service carries out an in-depth assessment on an organisation's security posture, benchmarked against globally-recognised frameworks. The risks are then communicated back to the organisation alongside a clear and structured roadmap for remediation, which ensures organisations have an action plan set to address issues effectively.\n\nTo support organisations, Data Connect's team of elite cyber security experts provide ongoing guidance to address issues, meaning customers always have accredited-excellence on hand.\n\nThere is also a user-friendly, interactive interface where customers can access their risk reports and clearly see the improvement roadmap, along with pre-agreed deadlines for remediation.\n\n\"We offer support to organisations after the assessment, helping them prioritise risks and make recommendations on the best steps for mitigation. No security posture is ever perfect, security is a journey, not a destination, but with our support, organisations can navigate that journey safely while making continuous progress towards resilience,\" continued Kean.\n\nPrior to taking the assessment, the Data Connect team will take time to understand the organisation to recognise what is important to their business, how the organisation functions, what investments have been made towards security, and what their risk appetite is. This allows the Data Connect team to gain an in-depth understanding of the organisation, so the assessment is tailored specifically to their individual requirements.\n\nThe service is also designed to bridge communication gaps between IT leaders and c-suite executives. This ensures that employees at every level are delivered information relevant to their understanding of risk, while empowering them to play a key role in improving organisational cyber maturity.\n\nThe features and benefits of vSOC Assure, include:",

        "full_text": "Premier League, Sky & ACE are celebrating the sentencing of one of the most elusive targets ever pursued in the pirate IPTV market. The man operated an IPTV empire out of Lebanon, supplying pirated content 'wholesale' all around world. Yet, despite an investigation that may already be close to a decade old, the man still isn't being named, and his platform isn't being named either. At least not officially.\n\nThe Premier League, UK broadcaster Sky, plus global anti-piracy coalition Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment, are reporting the conclusion of a \u2018landmark\u2019 pirate IPTV case in the Middle East.\n\nAccording to their statement, a joint criminal complaint in Lebanon led to an unnamed defendant being found guilty of five criminal charges, including unspecified intellectual property and cybercrime-related offenses.\n\nThe precise origin, nature, and date of a ruling cited in the announcement are not made clear although, at least to some extent, the ruling\u2019s requirements are more detailed.\n\nHighly Important Case, Unfortunately Low on Detail\n\nThe rightsholders state that the ruling orders the shutdown of the defendant\u2019s \u2018seized websites\u2019 and the deletion of all data from his \u2018devices\u2019. The identities and functions of those websites, including when and how they were seized, and the nature of the devices, including their function and what they contained, also go unexplained.\n\nA requirement that all accounts used for client and customer communication must be deleted, seems fairly straightforward, yet still lacks details usually associated with cases of such importance. Hoping to fill in the gaps, TorrentFreak requested a copy of the court order.\n\n\u201cThe court order is not public as it is classified as a non-public judicial decision and is subject to confidentiality under local legal procedures,\u201d we were informed.\n\nNo Doubt Over Platform\u2019s Importance\n\nThe person convicted and subsequently sentenced to serve 11 months in prison and pay more than US$90,000 in penalties and damages, \u201cwas the operator of a platform responsible for supplying illegal streams to pirate services around the world,\u201d the rightsholders confirm.\n\nIn common with its alleged operator, the service isn\u2019t named. While that\u2019s unfortunate from a reporting perspective, any frustration pales into insignificance when compared to the time, effort, and resources expended by the Premier League, Sky, and ACE on this case.\n\nEven from our very limited knowledge of the investigation, it seems likely to have been one of the longest of its type ever undertaken. Obtaining any type of conviction that is directly linked to the infamous Globe IPTV, as information shows, was never going to be easy.\n\nGlobe IPTV\n\nUse of the Globe brand in connection with TV piracy dates back over a decade. The supply of CCCAM servers focused on Sky broadcasts may have laid the groundwork for its entry into the IPTV market towards 2014/2015.\n\nGlobe\u2019s focus was on the supply of broadcasters\u2019 streams on a wholesale basis, as the Premier League\u2019s 2022 submission to the European Commission\u2019s Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List explains.\n\nSimilar claims featured in subsequent submissions to the EC and the USTR\u2019s Notorious Markets Report. Globe\u2019s \u2018wholesale\u2019 strategy meant that it \u201coperates higher up the IPTV ecosystem, selling content and services to resellers who then ultimately make the content available to the public,\u201d the Premier League explained.\n\nProminent Wholesale Supplier\n\nThe claim that Globe was known to have supplied multiple pirate services already sued by the Premier League is supported by the prosecution of Flawless TV, the largest case of its kind ever to conclude in the UK. When Flawless launched in August 2016, Globe was a major supplier to the operation.\n\nAmong other content, Globe supplied Flawless with premium content belonging to Sky and BT Sport, at rates fairly easily deduced from one of our earlier reports. The source of that content was cable operator Virgin Media, which for some time had faced consumer-end piracy on a massive scale.\n\nVirgin started to regain control in 2017 and with the introduction of new encryption around a year later, Globe\u2019s cable source in the UK was on life support. Satellite feeds remained viable, however, albeit at significant additional cost to Globe. Virgin Media\u2019s bill was significantly bigger; closing the loophole meant replacing millions of set-top boxes in homes across the UK.\n\nObscure References to Globe\n\nOver the past couple of years, various industry reports have mentioned Globe quite openly but on occasion, descriptions of events or scenarios that closely match existing knowledge about Globe have also made an appearance. Unaccompanied by the kind of detail required to remove all doubt, these seemingly random snapshots variously seemed to suggest that enforcement wasn\u2019t far away, or might even be imminent.\n\nFollowing a relatively recent event, also lacking information sufficient to make a provable connection, the signs suggested a potentially terminal blow from which Globe might never recover; albeit from one which it seemingly did.\n\nAt least for a while and in theory, potentially far longer than that.\n\n\u201cAnywhere in the World, Pirates Can Be Brought to Justice\u201d\n\nInformation has a tendency to be in constant short supply but there\u2019s just enough here to celebrate an anti-piracy achievement many years in the making.\n\n\u201cThe case further demonstrates the Premier League\u2019s commitment to protecting its intellectual property around the world,\u201d says Kevin Plumb, General Counsel at the Premier League.\n\n\u201cThis is not only important to us and our broadcast partners, but it is essential for the future health of English football and the protection of our fans. This case perfectly shows the benefits of working alongside other rights owners. I would like to thank our co-complainants, Sky and ACE, for their trusted partnership throughout these unique and complex proceedings leading up to this conviction.\u201d\n\nMatt Hibbert, Group Director of Anti-Piracy at Sky, says the ruling sends a strong message that pirates can be brought to justice, no matter where in the world they are.\n\n\u201cThe Lebanese judicial authorities in Lebanon, in collaboration with the Lebanese Cyber Crime Bureau successfully pursued the prosecution of this individual, who has been involved in the egregious theft of content for many years.\u201d\n\nAfter being placed on the United States\u2019 Special 301 watchlist in 2008, Lebanon reportedly did \u201cvery little\u201d to improve its protection of intellectual property rights for the next 14 years.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative removed Lebanon from the Special 301 Watchlist in its 2022 report.",

In his official statement to the authorities, he said, \"I will be careful next time such a thing does not happen again. My mental state is not well due to this whole case. My Canada tour also did not go well. I am sorry for what I said, I know what I said is wrong\".\n\nPrior to this, Samay delayed his return to India, and also rescheduled his India tour. The comedian recently took to the Stories section of his Instagram, and shared a note in which he said that he has rescheduled his India tour, and assured the audience of his tour that the the money from their tickets will soon be remitted to the source of their transactions.\n\nHe wrote, \"Hello guys, I'm rescheduling my India tour. You all will get refunds shortly, see you soon\".\n\nThe controversy erupted after comments made by Ranveer Allahbadia about parents and sex on comedian Samay Raina's show went viral on social media, sparking widespread backlash.\n\nVideo evidence shows that Ranveer, a podcaster, said, \"Would you rather watch your parents having sex or join them once and end it forever\".\n\nFollowing public outrage, multiple police complaints were filed against Allahbadia and other people associated with the show in both Mumbai and Guwahati. The cyber cell and the Mumbai police are conducting separate investigations in connection with Allahbadia's remarks on Reina's YouTube show 'India's Got Latent'.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "full_text": "Democrats have been floundering since losing the 2024 election. They have lost all three branches of the government. The public seems to have repudiated their woke progressivism. The base they were counting on in their strategy of identity politics\u2013blacks, hispanics, and the working class\u2013has turned against them.\n\nWhat should they do now? Some Democrats are saying the problem is that they weren\u2019t radical enough while others say they were too radical. Some are putting their hope in a revival of \u201cresistance\u201d to Donald Trump, thinking that if they demonize him enough, surely Americans will come to reject him. Others think that co-operating with the Republicans, at least to a degree, will improve their image.\n\nThe overall problem seems to be that Democrats lack a coherent ideology, one that can give their party direction and inspiration, and, more than that, make themselves popular with voters.\n\nTwo journalists, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, are proposing such an ideology, a new kind of liberalism. They have written a book entitled Abundance. It is a manifesto for what is being called \u201cAbundance Liberalism\u201d or \u201cSupply-Side Progressivism.\u201d\n\nHere is how Klein describes it in a piece for the New York Times entitled There Is a Liberal Answer to the Trump-Musk Wrecking Ball. (also available from out behind a paywall here):\n\nThe populist right is powered by scarcity. When there is not enough to go around, we look with suspicion on anyone who might take what we have. That suspicion is the fuel of Trump\u2019s politics. Scarcity \u2014 or at least the perception of it \u2014 is the precondition to his success. The answer to a politics of scarcity is a politics of abundance, a politics that asks what it is that people really need and then organizes government to make sure there is enough of it. That doesn\u2019t lend itself to the childishly simple divides that have so deformed our politics. Sometimes government has to get out of the way, as in housing. Sometimes it has to take a central role, creating markets or organizing resources for risky technologies that do not yet exist. Abundance reorients politics around a fresh provocation: Can we solve our problems with supply? Valuable questions bloom from this deceptively simple prompt. If there are not enough homes, can we make more? If not, why not? If there is not enough clean energy, can we make more? If not, why not? If the government is repeatedly failing to complete major projects on time and on budget, then what is going wrong, and how do we fix it? If we need new technologies to solve our important problems, how do we pull these inventions from the future and distribute them in the present?\n\nKlein admits that government and, indeed, liberal Democrats have been actively blocking such abundance. He wants that to stop. The regulations that stifle big projects and the attitudes that stifle growth are addressing the problems of a previous generation, but the problems have changed.\n\nUnherd\u2018s Sohale Mortazavi sums up Abundance Liberalism this way: \u201cIn their buzzy new book, Abundance, they argue that scarcity is a choice, and that \u2018to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need.\u2019 Progressives, in this telling, must be on the side of dynamism and productive capacity, even if this means bucking the Left\u2019s orthodoxies.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Klein and Thompson in The Free Press, Thompson says, \u201cI think we went from a world where liberalism was a liberalism of building, between the 1930s and 1960s, and then there was a turn in the 1960s and 1970s, and for the last half century, liberalism has too often meant a liberalism of blocking.\u201d\n\nAbundance Liberalism gets away from, for example, the ascetic strictures of the environmental movement, while still seeking to build technologies that will fight climate change. It tones down progressives\u2019 traditional class-warfare rhetoric going back to Karl Marx that demonizes business.\n\nIt is still progressive, though, in the sense of bringing back the old faith in \u201cprogress,\u201d the trust in science, technology, expertise, and social evolution that can bring on a bright, utopian future. This would seem to fit well into the current Democratic base, no longer the working class, but the affluent, well-educated \u201cknowledge class.\u201d\n\nBut, you might wonder, how are these policies and ideology different from what the Republicans are trying to do? What\u2019s the difference between Klein\u2019s technological utopia and Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d?\n\nThe Trump administration is also calling for abundance. Techno-optimists like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Marc Andreesen have been saying something similar\u2013as Klein and Thompson in their interview admit\u2013but they have aligned themselves with Trump. Though conflict with MAGA populists has arisen, J. D. Vance, with a foot in both worlds, is trying to reconcile the two.\n\nHere is the difference and what puts the \u201cliberalism\u201d in Abundance Liberalism. Klein and Thompson believe that a strong and active government is the key to achieving abundance. Whereas what we might call Abundance Conservatives believe that the key is unleashing the private sector.\n\nKlein tells the Free Press, \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re quite focused on is deregulating the government itself so government has more capacity to act, and act with a certain strength and capability. High-speed rail, or for that matter, public housing, are both good examples of this. There are places where you would want government to be able to act with more agency, more autonomy, and not be quite so vulnerable to endless lawsuits.\u201d\n\nKlein and Thompson have a big problem with Musk precisely because he is tearing government down. They want to build it up and make it both stronger and more effective.\n\nTrump and the Republicans, they say, are really all about scarcity. For example, they discuss the high cost of housing, due to a housing shortage. So we need to build more houses. They admit that the problem is worse in Democratic-run states, like California, due to all of the regulations, restrictions, environmental studies, union rules, etc., etc.\n\nThey see a better alternative in Texas, where it is much easier to build houses due to fewer regulations and where housing is much cheaper. Thompson, speaking of Trump, says to Free Press,\n\nHe could have said, let\u2019s make America like Texas. Let\u2019s make America the most housing abundant country in the world. Instead, what does he do? He raises tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Totally effing random, but let\u2019s follow along. Our number one source of lumber to build houses comes from Canada. Our number one source of gypsum drywall comes from Mexico. Two of the most important inputs for any new house you\u2019re going to build, we\u2019ve now slapped a 25 percent tariff on them. There\u2019s no way that does anything other than drive housing prices right up. And by the way, he\u2019s also decreasing immigration. Twenty-five percent of the construction labor force is foreign-born. In California, it\u2019s closer to 40 percent.\n\nOK, some fair points, but they have to do with Trump\u2019s stepping away from the usual Republican position of free markets. He argues, of course, that decreasing immigration will mean more jobs for Americans and that tariffs on foreign imports will encourage American companies to supply lumber and manufacture drywall. We\u2019ll see who is right.\n\nBut let\u2019s follow this along. Say the Abundance Liberals get control and government\u2013somehow gaining a competence it hasn\u2019t usually shown\u2013builds more houses, a \u201csupply-side\u201d solution. That will drive housing prices down. Will affluent \u201cknowledge class\u201d progressives appreciate the value of their homes going down? Will the Abundance Liberals abandon the unions, as Texas has? Will they make houses that people really want to live in, if they are supplying apart from consumer demand?\n\nThe biggest problem with Abundance Liberalism is that it means an even more powerful, all-pervasive government, one big enough to give us an abundance of everything. And, as a practical matter, government spending on a colossal scale at a time when it is already laboring under a $36.22 trillion debt.\n\nThompson admits to Free Press, \u201cI\u2019m a tax-and-spend liberal. I believe in high taxes on the wealthy because I believe in income distribution, because poverty, I believe, is a moral sin.\u201d\n\nWell, if you distribute income like that, you won\u2019t have anyone wealthy enough to pay high taxes! Of course, if you eliminate the private sector as a source of investment, the government will have to do it all.\n\nThat is socialism, a rather old-fashioned progressive idea, but this is what Abundance Liberalism comes to. To see the kind of building socialist governments manage, freed from market forces, go to Russia or other places ruled by the Soviet Union and see what\u2019s left of the ghastly, impersonal high rise apartments now crumbling from neglect, or talk to someone who lived under that kind of regime about the kinds of products available in their shops.\n\nIf Abundance Liberals rely on the tactic of \u201ctax and spend,\u201d they are not that different from regular liberals.\n\nIllustration via Amazon.com",

        "full_text": "A former municipal official \u2014 who was charged with theft and fraud by Manitoba RCMP earlier this year \u2014 was subject to an arrest warrant that was issued and put on hold twice after she missed two court dates within the last week.\n\nAmber Fisher, 40, is accused of faking a cyberattack during her time as the CAO of the Municipality of Gilbert Plains, about 350 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg, in an attempt to cover more than $500,000 she allegedly stole from the community in 2020 and 2021.\n\nLast January, RCMP arrested Fisher and charged her with fraud over $5,000, theft over $5,000, and knowingly using proceeds of crime. She was released from custody with conditions.\n\nBut Manitoba provincial court Judge Geoffrey Bayly issued a warrant for Fisher's arrest on March 18, after she failed to appear at a hearing in Dauphin, Man., according to court recordings reviewed by CBC News.\n\nBayly had the warrant held until this Monday, the day Fisher was once again expected to appear in the Dauphin court, but she didn't show up to that hearing, either.\n\nHer release conditions included one that required her to be present for court dates until a lawyer agreed to represent her in court, Bayly said.\n\n\"Ms. Fisher knew to be here. She knew to be in court on the 18th. She's not here,\" he said Monday.\n\n\"The endorsed warrant that I had issued previously, but held to today's date, will be released [in order] to be executed by the RCMP.\"\n\nBrett Gladstone, the lawyer representing Fisher, told CBC News that Bayly put the arrest warrant for Fisher on hold again \"as a result of the information I shared with him\" around 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nFisher is expected back in court on March 31, he said.\n\nA student of Gladstone's had spoken to Bayly during the two hearings that Fisher missed, saying the lawyer had been partially retained by the former CAO but was not ready to agree to represent her in court.\n\n'Disappointing': Reeve\n\nFisher began to work for Gilbert Plains in 2018 and was promoted to chief administrative officer in April 2020.\n\nShe was fired in November 2022, after a forensic accounting and financial investigation report by MNP found she had transferred about $532,000 of the municipality's money to her bank account while she was CAO.\n\nThe municipality sued her in 2023, and a default judgment ruled in the municipality's favour after Fisher did not submit a statement of defence. The default judgment ordered Fisher to pay $525,000, with an annual interest rate of five per cent.\n\nA Manitoba court ordered the seizure of her wages last October.\n\nGilbert Plains Reeve Jim Manchur said Fisher was expected to enter a plea on the charges in her recent court dates, and that sparked intrigue.\n\nThe judge also wondered why so many people were in the courtroom last week.\n\n\"There's a number of people in the body of the court,\" Bayly said in the March 18 hearing, after the warrant for Fisher's arrest was initially issued and held. \"I'm just wondering, is anyone here expecting their name to be on the docket?\"\n\n\"They're here for the Fisher matter,\" a man is heard replying.\n\nFisher's absence from court over the last week is part of a pattern for the former CAO, who showed a lack of co-operation during the forensic audit and subsequent RCMP investigation, Manchur said.\n\n\"It's kind of disappointing to see.\"\n\nThe municipality is considering whether it should introduce a special levy to cover a financial deficit at Gilbert Plains, he said. That deficit includes accounting and legal fees associated with Fisher's alleged theft and fraud.\n\nThose details are expected to be finalized before a public presentation of the municipality's upcoming budget on April 10, he said.\n\nCBC News has reached out to Fisher for comment several times, but she has not responded.",

        "full_text": "watch now\n\nScammers are always looking at ways to separate you from your money and they are using the tax season to try and trick taxpayers into falling for various fraud schemes. With millions of Americans sharing personal and financial information, tax season is a prime time for scammers to steal not just your refund but also your identity, experts say. \"Anybody can be a victim,\" said Jennifer Hessing, who works as a fraud analytics director at Wells Fargo. Hessing said she experienced having someone file a tax return in her name with stolen personal information. The Internal Revenue Service caught the fraudulent filing, and Hessing now has established an identity protection PIN with the IRS.\n\nSet up an identity protection PIN\n\nHessing's precaution is a smart one to emulate. An IP PIN \u2014 a unique six-digit number \u2014 verifies your identity when you file an electronic or paper return, and prevents someone else from filing a tax return with your personal information. Victims of tax-related identity theft who have resolved their issues receive a new PIN mailed to them from the IRS each year. Individuals can also proactively request an IP PIN through the IRS. Your spouse and dependents are also eligible for an IP PIN if once they go through a verification process. \"Don't wait to become a victim to receive this,\" Hessing said.\n\nUnderscoring the growing sophistication of scams targeting taxpayers, Americans lost $9.1 billion in fraud from tax and financial crimes in 2024, according to the IRS. \"It's not a fringe issue anymore, said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at McAfee, a cybersecurity company. Nearly one in four Americans, 23%, have been impacted by a tax scam at some point, according to a recent McAfee survey.\n\nIgnore unexpected tax emails, texts\n\nOne of the easiest ways to avoid getting scammed is to ignore urgent-looking text or email messages that claim to be from the government or a tax preparation service, experts say. Fraudsters often use urgency and fear tactics in their messages to manipulate victims into acting quickly without verifying the source's legitimacy, aiming to steal sensitive information or install malware, experts explain. The IRS says it doesn't initiate contact via text or email regarding tax payments or refunds. If you receive an unexpected message about a tax issue, don't react impulsively, experts say. Don't click on any links in the message. Instead, verify its source directly through the IRS website or your trusted tax professional. \"The IRS won't be calling you, demanding instant payment,\" Hessing said, or threatening \"that you will get deported or jailed if you don't pay your bill right now.\"\n\nDon't pay your tax bill with crypto\n\nMeanwhile, scammers are studying demographics for cryptocurrency schemes. Men are more often targets of crypto tax scams, according to McAfee. \"They [scammers] are creating narratives that sound plausible, such as, if you pay your taxes with cryptocurrency, you can extend the deadline or have a discount,\" Grobman said. (Neither claim is correct. Plus, the IRS does not allow you to pay your federal tax bill with crypto, although some states will allow it.) Unlike credit cards and bank transactions, there's a lack of safeguards to paying with digital currency. The IRS treats crypto as property for tax purposes and does not accept it as payment. \"If you pay somebody with cryptocurrency more often than not, the money is gone,\" Grobman said.\n\nImprove your 'cyber hygiene'\n\nTo help protect your personal data, experts encourage taxpayers to use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable two-factor authentication where possible. Also, never re-use passwords for online accounts and never share passwords with anyone. Reach out to your financial institutions to find out what security measures are available. \"Asking to understand how you can better lock down your digital life is great cyber hygiene for folks that are in an unfortunate position to have been involved in a scam,\" Grobman said.\n\nWhat to do if you've been scammed",

        "full_text": "One Manitoban has mixed feelings about receiving a break on his Hydro bills next cycle.\n\nCurrently, Manitoba Hydro customers who use natural gas pay what's called a \"federal carbon charge\" on their monthly bills. Earlier this month, Prime Minster Mark Carney signed a directive to remove the consumer carbon tax effective April 1, and the first place Manitobans might notice the change could be their Hydro bills.\n\nRyan Kochie, a homeowner in the Elmwood area where he lives with his partner and their four children, says the carbon charge was a large portion of his natural gas bill.\n\n\"Looking back at February with our $100 bill, [the federal carbon charge] was about $40 on that bill.\"\n\nRemoving the monthly carbon charge will help with the cost of living, Kochie says, while adding he's going to miss the carbon tax rebate he used to get every three months.\n\nSpokesman Peter Chura says Manitoba Hydro only collected the federal carbon charge and remitted the money to the federal government. (Warren Kay/CBC)\n\n\"It was definitely a nice bonus to help with unexpected bills and stuff,\" Kochie said.\n\n\"We're very careful in our budgeting as a family of four, so we're watching everything anyway, but having that bonus just helps that monthly budget out, and helps us put more into savings.\"\n\nKochie says he has friends living cheque to cheque who depend on the carbon tax rebate to stay afloat.\n\nManitoba Hydro's website says the average household used 2,075 cubic metres of natural gas in 2024 at a cost of roughly $316, or just over $26 a month in carbon tax.\n\nPrices of gasoline will drop April 1 when the carbon tax is removed from fuel prices. (Prabhjot Lotey/CBC)\n\nPeter Chura, media relations officer for Manitoba Hydro, says the Public Utilities Board had to approve the changes to Hydro bills before they could be reflected on customers' bills.\n\n\"The federal carbon charge will not apply to any natural gas used by our customers on or after April 1. It will still apply the gas used before then, so that will still appear on customers' bills in a prorated fashion.\"\n\nChura says customers on an equal payment plan will see a slight change in their hydro bills as well.\n\nHe said the federal carbon charge wasn't being paid to Hydro.\n\n\"The federal carbon charge was levied by the federal government. They set the amounts and we would simply collect it on their behalf and then remit that to the federal government.\"\n\nPrior to the change in carbon tax policy, Chura says, tax was scheduled to rise on April 1. As a result, some customers might find a pamphlet with their bill that refers to the federal carbon charge going up, even though it's going to disappear altogether.\n\nEcology group discouraged by carbon tax removal\n\nManitobans can expect to see savings at the pump, too.\n\nGas prices will fall almost 18 cents a litre, or about $9 less to fill a 50-litre tank. Before Carney scrapped the carbon tax, gas prices were slated to rise another three cents.\n\nThe Manitoba Eco Network says it's discouraged to see the removal of the consumer carbon tax.\n\nExecutive director James Beddome wants to know what policy will be implemented in its place that encourages people to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n\"Can we expect to see the Carney government end all subsidies to the oil-and-gas sector, for instance? Can we expect to see them put major investments into public transportation? Beddome said.\n\n\"Can we expect to see them, sort of lay down the line in the regulatory approach \u2026 that we're going to go away from fossil fuels, which unfortunately isn't what I've heard in some of the first opening remarks.\"\n\nBeddome says the carbon tax alone wasn't going to get Canada to meet its climate change goals, but it was better than nothing.\n\n\"Certainly we need more than just pricing on greenhouse gas emissions, but it's disappointing that politics has won out over good policy,\" Beddome said, referring to the divisive nature of the carbon tax.\n\nKochie also thinks the carbon tax was dividing the country. He said he understands why the Liberals chose to abandon it, but he hopes there's more climate policy in the works.\n\n\"I really hope this doesn't mean they're going to abandon climate action overall,\" Kochie said. \"We need to be actively working against [climate change], healing our planet instead of making it worse.\"",

Become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles, webinars and ebooks.\n\nOnce an outdoor educator, Laura Wildenborg spent 10 years taking kids on field trips to go rock climbing or cross-country skiing across the region, all to inspire children to love and care for the environment.\n\nAfter receiving her MBA in 2020, she made a drastic career pivot \u2014 to banking. But she brought her care for the environment along with her.\n\n\u201cThat love of the outdoors, that was such an important aspect of what I was doing, and I wanted to carry that through into my next role,\u201d says Wildenborg, vice president of strategic lending for Sunrise Banks, a community development financial institution based in St. Paul, Minnesota. \u201cFinding myself at a bank, I realized banks have incredible power to influence change.\u201d\n\nWildenborg serves as a project leader for Sunrise Banks\u2019 net zero banking initiative, which launched in July 2024. Net zero banking refers to the investment in projects that will reduce or eliminate carbon emissions. Customers of the bank can opt in and allow their deposits to be loaned out only to net zero projects. Since launching its net zero program, Sunrise Banks has received $5.5 million in deposits and has loaned out nearly $22 million.\n\nRead more: The CDFI Fund Is Under Fire. What Does That Mean for Community Development?\n\nSunrise Banks started the initiative as part of its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and to align with the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to limit global temperature increases by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. (President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement just hours after taking office.)\n\nAs of now, Sunrise Banks customers can only participate in the program through deposits, but the bank plans to expand the program this year.\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t realize that when they deposit their money with a bank, those funds are loaned out to projects,\u201d Wildenborg says. \u201cWith this program at Sunrise, we put that money where our values are, which means in the projects that will reduce carbon emissions \u2014 in turn having a positive impact on our community and environment.\u201d\n\nWildenborg says one customer shared that he never thought about what the money in his bank account was used for. After realizing he wants to create a more sustainable future for his kids, he moved all his money to Sunrise Banks and opted into the net zero deposits program.\n\n\u201cThe more they understand how their money is used,\u201d Wildenborg says, \u201cthe more empowered they can be to ensure that their money is going towards cutting their own bank emissions and helping build resilient climate resilient communities.\u201d\n\nThe Firefly multi-family development. (Photo courtesy Sunrise Bank)\n\nAlong with individual bank customers, 10 nonprofit organizations that work with Sunrise Banks are also participating in the net zero deposits program.\n\nProjects that include clean energy, energy reduction, efficiency updates, green buildings, and clean transportation, and more are eligible for net zero financing at Sunrise Banks.\n\nDevelopers Adam Jonas and Jay Rajaratnam were among the first recipients of Sunrise Banks\u2019 net zero deposits program. Jonas and Rajaratnam opened Firefly, a fully sustainable multi-family home in Minneapolis, in July. Sunrise Banks granted a $1.75 million net zero construction loan to the project. The building has 10 tenants with two moving in soon, making it fully occupied.\n\n\u201cWe want to not just meet that threshold of being net zero,\u201d Jonas said. \u201cIf the building is not beautiful and loved, it doesn\u2019t help. We need to create things that are valued, beautiful and inspiring to help further the cause.\u201d\n\nAs they developed Firefly, Rajaratnam and Jonas also started the Sustainable Developers Collective to share advice and effective practices with other developers. Sunrise Banks hosted one of their first meet-ups.\n\nRajaratnam said that companies often just pay lip service to environmental initiatives, but after working closely with Sunrise Banks, he feels they are effectively standing behind their mission.\n\n\u201cIt was beyond just banking,\u201d Jonas says. \u201cSustainable Developers Collective is really trying to bring those individuals together so we can learn better, quicker and more efficiently \u2014 financing is such a big part of that. It\u2019s a testament to Sunrise\u2019s commitment to sustainability that they were in that conversation from day one.\u201d\n\nSunrise Banks is accepting applications for loans towards projects like Firefly.\n\n\u201cYou have the potential to do work that will last beyond you. What Sunrise is doing enables us to do that,\u201d Rajaratnam says. \u201cIf our kids don\u2019t live here, someone else\u2019s kids will be in this space well after we\u2019re gone, and what we do today will have an impact on them.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of our series, CDFI Futures, which explores the community development finance industry through the lenses of equity, public policy and inclusive community development.

Despite the U.S. sanctions, Venezuela last year enjoyed an over 10% increase in oil imports, to the highest since 2019, at 772,000 barrels daily. Some 200,000 bpd of this went to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, despite the sanctions, after the Biden administration granted Chevron a waiver so it could resume operations in the South American nation.\n\nPresident Trump, however, has refused to extend Chevron\u2019s sanction waiver, instead opting for a double down on more sanctions\u2014this time in the form of tariffs. Earlier this week, Trump announced that any country that buys oil and gas from Venezuela will face 25% tariffs on its trade with the United States. The tariff slap is part of Trump\u2019s push to curb illegal migration, including from Venezuela, which, he said, had sent \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people to the U.S. who have a \u201cvery violent nature.\u201d\n\nChina is by far the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking in some 500,000 barrels daily, both directly and indirectly, according to Reuters, accounting for the bulk of total exports, based on the latest figures. India also imports Venezuelan crude\u2014in growing volumes\u2014as do Italy, Spain, and Cuba.\n\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com",

        "full_text": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nThis story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nIf the only things certain in life are death and taxes, you might say corporate lobbyists spend much of their time trying to avoid at least one of the two. Few industries understand this better than oil and gas, which has benefited for at least a century from some tax rules that save them billions of dollars in payments annually.\n\nThe world\u2019s nations have agreed to phase out fossil fuel subsidies globally. The Biden administration pledged to axe them domestically. Still, they persist.\n\nNow, with Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration determined to enact $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and desperately looking for revenue and spending cuts to pay for them, some environmental advocacy groups are highlighting the tax benefits that flow to one of the world\u2019s most profitable industries, which the Biden administration estimated at $110 billion over the decade ending in 2034.\n\nThe oil and gas industry, meanwhile, is playing both offense and defense, trying to maintain the benefits it has while working to enact at least one new one, which would shield some oil companies from a tax enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\n\u201cThey make huge payments to governments around the world, including to some in some pretty shady places.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest sources of new revenue from the IRA was a corporate alternative minimum tax, which was meant to prevent companies that reported large profits to investors from using loopholes to pay little to no taxes.\n\nThe minimum tax applies to all industries. For oil and gas, it has hit some of the large independent drillers in particular (as opposed to the \u201cintegrated\u201d majors like ExxonMobil and Chevron). The money involved is significant: According to a new analysis by United to End Polluter Handouts, a coalition of environmental and progressive groups, at least three companies\u2014EOG Resources, APA Corp. and Ovintiv\u2014reported paying nearly $200 million collectively to the Treasury under the minimum tax since it was enacted in 2022.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-OK) has introduced a bill that would change the calculus by allowing oil companies to deduct some of their largest expenses against the minimum tax. Lankford\u2019s bill is included as a priority in the policy blueprint of the American Exploration & Production Council, which represents large independent oil and gas companies.\n\nLukas Shankar-Ross, an author of the new minimum-tax analysis and deputy director of the climate and energy justice program at Friends of the Earth, pointed out that the Lankford bill would either deepen deficits or force more cuts to programs like Medicaid or other assistance for low-income Americans.\n\n\u201cI think it is as shameful a thing for me to imagine as is possible now,\u201d Shankar-Ross said.\n\nThe oil and gas sector is the top industry contributor to Lankford\u2019s campaigns in recent years, giving more than $546,000 since 2019, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nA spokesperson for Lankford said, \u201cPromoting American energy independence is a reversal of the Biden Administration\u2019s policies. Strong domestic energy production makes us less reliant on adversaries, and empowering oil and gas producers makes the United States stronger. Nobody is looking at cutting Medicaid benefits in order to pay for tax cuts, but fraud, waste, and abuse in the program should be examined.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the largest oil and gas companies, however, their focus might be elsewhere. When the American Petroleum Institute issued its five-point policy roadmap for the Trump administration and Congress in November, it highlighted a need to maintain what it called \u201ccrucial international tax provisions.\u201d\n\nJust one of those provisions, the so-called dual capacity taxpayer rule, is expected to save oil and gas companies $71.5 billion over a decade, according to Biden administration estimates.\n\nBroadly speaking, federal tax law allows corporations to credit taxes they pay to foreign governments on overseas income against their US tax bills to avoid being taxed twice. The dual capacity taxpayer rule allows oil companies wide latitude in defining what exactly constitutes a tax payment, with the result being that they can count royalties and other payments as taxes, said Zorka Milin, policy director at the Financial Accountability & Corporate Transparency Coalition, which works to combat harmful impacts of illicit finance.\n\nIn fact, in some cases U.S. oil and gas companies might pay more in taxes and other payments to foreign governments than they do to the United States.\n\nExxon paid billions in overseas royalties alone in 2023, including $1.8 billion to the United Arab Emirates, $1 billion to the Canadian province Alberta, and $761 million to Nigeria. Chevron paid about $2 billion in royalties to foreign governments.\n\nMilin said it is unclear how much of these royalty payments Exxon, Chevron and other oil companies might have claimed as credits against their US taxes, but it could run into the billions of dollars annually.\n\n\u201cThey make huge payments to governments around the world, including to some in some pretty shady places, and what is adding insult to injury is a lot of those payments are used to offset payments they pay here in the US,\u201d Milin said. \u201cThat\u2019s one way in which our tax code is subsidizing these companies to go abroad and drill, baby, drill, but not domestically.\u201d\n\nExxon, Chevron and the American Petroleum Institute did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, which supports pro-growth tax policies, said many of the oil industry-specific tax rules do not qualify as subsidies. Several of the rules, such as one that allows oil companies to deduct their drilling costs upfront, rather than over a well\u2019s productive life, put the industry on an equal footing with other sectors, he argued. Oil companies often have high costs upfront that generate returns over many years, which can put them at a tax disadvantage with other industries, Muresianu said.\n\nWhen it comes to royalties, these payments to mineral owners are generally tax deductible. But the dual capacity taxpayer rule offers a far better deal by turning them into a credit, an important distinction. Say Company A earned $100 million in profits, paid $5 million in royalties and paid the full 21 percent corporate income tax. Taking the royalty payments as a credit rather than a deduction would save it nearly $4 million. (US tax laws are complex, so limitations might apply.)\n\nMilin argued that Congress ought to look at the foreign tax breaks, especially as they are searching for more revenue, because these benefits effectively subsidize oil companies to drill overseas. \u201cWhen we have a more explicitly America First international economic policy on trade, on other issues, I think they are likely to look at the ways in which the tax code as it stands is inconsistent with that,\u201d Milin said.\n\n\n\n",

        "full_text": "Tradeswomen have spent decades fighting for their place in the skilled trades. Now they\u2019re suing the Trump administration over its anti-DEI policies.\n\nThis is your first of three free stories this month. Become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles, webinars and ebooks.\n\nThis story was originally published by The 19th.\n\nFor decades, women have worked diligently to carve out a space in the construction workforce, where discrimination and sexual harassment have kept the predominantly male industry, well, male.\n\nAcross the country, they organized for recognition. First in small committees that cropped up in places like Fort Worth, Texas, where in 1953, women came together to create their own support network later called the National Association of Women in Construction. Over the years they worked with their unions and created nonprofits in places like Oregon, Wisconsin, Vermont, Florida and Chicago to advocate for issues affecting women like how to change the hostile workplace culture, and deal with the persistent lack of child care for the early hours they often work.\n\nThe government created its own policies to ensure federal contractors were doing their due diligence to recruit and hire from a diverse workforce. But the Biden administration in particular was a boon to the movement, says Jayne Vellinga, executive director of Chicago Women in Trades (CWIT), a nonprofit aimed at bringing more women into construction jobs.\n\nUnder Biden, the Commerce Department announced its goal to bring a million women into construction jobs, and created a requirement that recipients of large federal grants for semiconductor manufacturing include a plan for child care. The administration had also passed two laws aimed at boosting infrastructure in the country, which created a demand for skilled workers.\n\nIt was the perfect storm of opportunity and funding to expand their programming to bring more women into the workforce. \u201cOur placement numbers have never been higher,\u201d Vellinga says. But when Donald Trump returned to the White House, the forward momentum collapsed almost overnight. In a fiery inauguration speech, he declared he would dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the government and create what he calls a color-blind, merit-based society. He promptly issued two executive orders calling DEI policies immoral and illegal and vowed to claw back funding.\n\nJust two days later, CWIT received word that all of its federal grants were under review. These grants constitute 40% of CWIT\u2019s budget, and the loss would jeopardize the future of the nonprofit\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWe have complete whiplash,\u201d Vellinga says.\n\nAdditionally, the tariffs have disrupted the construction industry, leading to a potential slowdown in projects and consequentially less need for workers, she says.\n\nRead more: Tariff Whiplash and HUD Cuts Will Cripple Affordable Housing Development\n\nThe nonprofit, whose participants overwhelmingly identify as Black and Latina women, offers pre-apprenticeship training covering topics like workplace safety and basic technical skills. It also partners with unions and industry leaders to advocate for workplaces free of discrimination and harassment, and trains employers in how to make construction sites more inclusive of women.\n\nIt\u2019s work that is desperately needed in an industry where one in four women say they are always or frequently harassed, and where one in five LGBTQ+ workers say the same, according to findings from the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy and Research. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a report in 2023, which found that discrimination was still rampant in the industry, citing several instances of employers not hiring people because of their gender or race.\n\nBut that report has been erased from the website, and Vellinga says she feels like the reality of who is being discriminated against is being erased, too. \u201cThis narrative that women are taking jobs away from more qualified people has never been true. They are qualified and just asking companies to overcome whatever biases to give them a fair shot.\u201d\n\nThe efforts taken to dismantle their work might also not be legal. In February, the nonprofit filed a lawsuit against the administration and several agencies, including the Department of Labor, seeking to declare the DEI executive orders unconstitutional. They are also suing on the grounds that the clawback of federal funds is outside of the jurisdiction of the Executive Branch since they are approved by Congress, and that it\u2019s also infringing on their First Amendment right to free speech.\n\n\u201cWhat the Trump administration is trying to do is say that for you to receive this federal funding you have to adopt the administration\u2019s viewpoint that DEI is impermissible, and you have to agree with our political agenda,\u201d says Gaylynn Burroughs, a lawyer from the National Women\u2019s Law Center, one of the organizations that is representing the CWIT in court. \u201cThe government is not allowed to do that.\u201d\n\nCatherine Fisk, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says in effect the orders chill constitutionally protected speech and threaten legal action against organizations who cannot know what it is that they are prohibited from doing because it\u2019s so vague. \u201cThat is both a First Amendment violation that is broadly prohibiting advocacy and a due process violation,\u201d she says: \u201cThe government is threatening to punish people without being clear of what they are being punished for.\u201d\n\nThe 19th reached out to the Department of Labor, The Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Justice, which were all named as defendants, but did not hear back by press time.\n\nPromoting diversity, equity and inclusion is not illegal, and these executive orders are a way to attack ideals fundamental to American society, Burroughs says. \u201cWhen you peel it back, what we\u2019re really talking about is the ability for people to not be discriminated against,\u201d she says. \u201cWe do a disservice when we\u2019re saying that it\u2019s an attack on DEI. It\u2019s an attack on civil rights, on workplace anti-discrimination.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cThe message that is being conveyed is, if you are not a white heterosexual man, and you are in public life, or you are in a job where you are successful, that you must have gotten there because of some unfair advantage, and that is really a poisonous way of thinking.\u201d\n\nIn addition to endangering federal funding for DEI work, the Trump administration also rescinded an executive order that had been in place since 1965. The order prohibited federal contractors from discriminating in its hiring practices and required them to take affirmative actions to ensure that it was trying to recruit and hire women and people of color for its jobs, which are paid for with taxpayer dollars and in theory should be accessible to anyone who is qualified. Because some groups have been so effectively shut out of certain jobs, that work can look like providing opportunities for specific groups like women to learn skills and receive training to be competitive applicants in the job pool.\n\nTo help enforce the 1965 order, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs could perform audits on job sites to also ensure the workplaces were protecting employers equal rights. Jenny Yang, the former director of the office under Biden, says in some cases an audit has uncovered that women don\u2019t have proper fitting personal protective equipment which can pose a safety risk, or are being harassed or discriminated against in other ways.\n\n\u201cHaving an OFCCP investigator auditing those practices is what often catalyzes change because workers see that the federal government is there,\u201d she says. It also offers workers an opportunity to report issues with their workplace anonymously versus having to file a complaint against their employer, which can open them up to retribution.\n\nThe agency has also played a role in correcting pay discrimination by conducting pay audits, says Yang. From 2014 to 2024 the agency obtained $261 million for employees and job seekers who were discriminated against. That money went to over 250,000 employees and applicants. That number included about 25,000 White people and men, who were alleged to have been discriminated against. \u201cOur anti discrimination laws protect everyone,\u201d Yang says.\n\nBut now that agency is being whittled down to a ghost of itself, with reports that the Department of Labor plans to lay off 90% of staff. The order announcing the rescindment says the work going forward would only apply to veterans and people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cThe rescission of the executive order will have devastating consequences for workers and especially for women in the trades, many who have says they wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to support their families because of the discrimination many women face in that industry,\u201d says Yang.\n\nThat\u2019s because the opportunities afforded to women without college degrees pay much differently than those offered to men. It\u2019s a phenomena known as occupation segregation, says Vellinga. \u201cOur culture does not value the caretaking role, the roles that women have traditionally played, as much as they have valued the roles that men have traditionally played,\u201d she says.\n\nAn example she likes to use is the difference between how the country pays certified nursing assistants, of which 88% are women, versus carpenters. Neither job requires a college degree, and both are physically demanding. But the median wage for nurse assistants is just $40,000 compared to $61,000 for carpenters according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Carpenters are also more likely to have pensions.\n\nNow she fears that with a loss of protections in the workplace, and a fear from employers to even engage in DEI, those opportunities for women will just dry up. And her organization\u2019s ability to bridge the gap in employment will be crippled.\n\nIf their federal funds are canceled they won\u2019t be able to offer as many trainings, they won\u2019t be able to work with employers to create workplaces free of discrimination and harassment, and they won\u2019t be able to do as much outreach to educate women and girls that these opportunities even exist in the first place.\n\n\u201cFor an organization who has spent decades trying to change a culture, we are still so far from the finish line,\u201d Vellinga says. Nearly 96% of construction workers, to this day, are men. \u201cIt is really incredible that you could not acknowledge that reality.\u201d",

        "full_text": "Yves here. Even though most geopolitically oriented eyes are focused on Ukraine, the related peace talks, and the dangerously simmering situation in the Middle East, particularly serious US noises about mixing it up with Iran, there are secondary flash points related to these conflicts that can add heat to these fires. One general category that most readers know well is the way the weak players, the EU ex Hungary and Slovakia, and particularly the UK and the Baltic states, are determined to throw a spanner into a possible settlement of the Ukraine conflict.\n\nThis post reinforces a point yours truly has made repeatedly: Putin can win the war but still lose the peace. The UK and his friends are determined to make that happen if they can. Recall that Putin\u2019s aim is not simply to stop the fighting, but to create \u201ca new European security architecture\u201d. The next best would be to establish a durable acceptance by the key players in Europe of the resolution.\n\nThe problem here is Europeans have been fed decades of swill about how monstrous Russians and Putin are, and that propagandizing has become more intense over the course of the war. Additionally, the Baltic states are stuck in a time warp, regarding modern Russia as no different than the now long dead Soviet Union.\n\nProfessor John Mearsheimer has warned that there won\u2019t be a clean and well-accepted outcome to this war, even assuming a US-Russia \u201cdeal\u201d. He identified multiple hot spots settlement refusniks could keep stoking, from Transnistria to Kaliningrad to one of areas discussed below, the Baltics. Recall also that NATO has nuclear capable missiles installed in Romania and Poland. Unless the latter systems are removed, Russia is still under threat, albeit not as acute as with a belligerent and once well-armed NATO proxy on its doorstep. All it takes is a regime change in DC for the US to go on a hostile footing again. With Trump on track to tank the economy, and Vance having the worst poll ratings of any VP at this point in his tenure, Vance 2028 does not look like a great bet, even allowing for the abject awfulness of the Dem bench. Of course, I charitably assuming the US actually does hold elections then.\n\nBy Andrew Korybko, a Moscow-based American political analyst who specializes in the global systemic transition to multipolarity in the New Cold War. He has a PhD from MGIMO, which is under the umbrella of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Originally published at his website\n\nPutin\u2019s senior aide Nikolai Patrushev, who ran the FSB for nearly a decade (1999-2008) before chairing the Security Council for over 15 years till recently (2008-2024), shared some updates about the Baltic and Arctic fronts of the New Cold War in a recent interview with Russia\u2019s National Defense magazine. He began by blaming the Brits for orchestrating Baltic tensions in order to disrupt the incipient Russian-US normalization process and associated talks on Ukraine.\n\nIn connection with that, he also warned that some NATO members (presumably led by the British) are practicing cyberattacks against Russian ships\u2019 navigation equipment and suggested that they might have been responsible for recent claims of sabotage in the Baltic, which prompted a larger naval presence. This same expanded presence poses a threat to Russia\u2019s interests and could manifest itself through terrorist attacks against its underwater pipelines, tankers, and dry cargo ships.\n\nRussia plans to defend against this through unmanned underwater systems and strengthening its Baltic Fleet. As for one of the worst-case conventional threats, that of Finland and Estonia teaming up to blockade Russia inside the Gulf of Finland, Patrushev expressed confidence that his country could overcome that plot and punish the aggressors. This segued the conversation into a discussion about Finland, which Patrushev said has a friendly population, unlike its government.\n\nHe mentioned how the authorities there distort history to avoid talking about the goal of \u201cGreater Finland\u201d, which took the form of occupying Northwestern Russia, placing its inhabitants into concentration camps, and exterminating the Slavs there. Just like Finland was used by the Nazis as a springboard for aggression against the USSR, so too did Patrushev warn that plans might be afoot for NATO to use it as a springboard potential aggression against Russia.\n\nHe then said a few words about how the Arctic is opening up as a new front of competition, mostly due to its resources, but reaffirmed that Russia wants peace and cooperation there instead of rivalry. The Northern Sea Route (NSR), which commemorates its 500th-year conceptualization this year, can help bring that about. Russia will continue developing regional infrastructure and building ice-class vessels for facilitating transit through these waters year-round. It was on that note that the interview ended.\n\nReviewing Patrushev\u2019s briefing, the first part about blaming the Brits for tensions in the Baltic aligns with what Russia\u2019s Foreign Spy Service (SVR) recently claimed about how the UK is trying to sabotage Trump\u2019s envisaged \u201cNewD\u00e9tente\u201d. It might therefore very well be that they\u2019re attempting to open up this front for that purpose, first through unconventional acts of aggression like \u201cplausibly deniable\u201d terrorist attacks and then possibly escalating to a joint Finnish-Estonian blockade of the Gulf of Finland.\n\nExposing these plots and expressing confidence in Russia\u2019s ability to overcome them were meant to respectively ensure that the Trump Administration is aware of what the UK is doing and to deter the UK\u2019s regional proxies from going along with this since the US and even the UK might hang them out to dry. Patrushev\u2019s words about Finland were important too in the sense of reminding everyone that governments don\u2019t always reflect the will of the people on the foreign policy front.\n\nAt the same time, however, everyone should also be aware of the Finnish government\u2019s historical distortions and the threat that its reckless foreign policy poses to its own people. Wrapping everything up, Patrushev pointed to the Arctic\u2019s importance in Russia\u2019s future planning, and his reaffirmation of its peaceful intentions could be interpreted as a willingness to partner with the US there like their representatives discussed last month in Riyadh. The NSR can also become a vector for cooperation too.\n\nPutting everything together, the Arctic front of the New Cold War is thawing a lot quicker than the Baltic one since the first is where the US could prospectively cooperate with Russia while the second is where the UK could try to provoke a crisis with Russia, but it remains to be seen whether any of this will unfold. Russian-US cooperation in the Arctic is likely conditional on a ceasefire in Ukraine whereas a Russian-NATO conflict in the Baltic orchestrated by the Brits is conditional on them misleading the US about this.\n\nPutin\u2019s interest in a lasting political solution to the Ukrainian Conflict bodes well for the Arctic scenario just like Trump\u2019s criticism of NATO bodes ill for the Baltic one so both ultimately come down to their will. They\u2019re the two most powerful people on the planet so their ties will greatly determine what comes next on those fronts and every other one too. It\u2019s precisely for this reason why the British want to ruin their relations, but after Patrushev just exposed their Baltic plot, that\u2019s a lot less likely to succeed than before.",

        "full_text": "'The future of the North Sea is in our hands', OEUK Chief Executive David Whitehouse said.\n\nOffshore Energies UK\u2019s (OEUK) 2025 Business Outlook report shows that, under the right business conditions, half of the 13-15 billion barrels of oil and gas the UK is projected to need by 2050 could be produced at home, a release sent to Rigzone by the OEUK team stated.\n\nThis would add up to GBP 150 billion ($193.7 billion) of gross value to the UK economy on top of the GBP 200 billion ($258.3 billion) from planned production, safeguarding energy security, jobs and lower carbon emissions alongside an acceleration of renewables, the release noted.\n\n\u201cThe independent Climate Change Committee estimates the UK requires 13-15 billion barrels of oil and gas by 2050, the target date for the economy to achieve net zero,\u201d OEUK said in the release.\n\n\u201cThe UK is on track to produce four billion of these barrels. Yet the report finds with the right polices to encourage firms to invest, another three billion barrels could be produced at home to meet half of the UK\u2019s needs rather than increasing its reliance on imports,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cThe report also finds that by 2050, when UK electricity demand has more than doubled, oil and gas will still form a fifth of UK energy needs,\u201d it continued.\n\nOEUK highlighted in the release that the publication of its Business Outlook coincides with government consultations with industry on the future of the North Sea and the oil and gas fiscal regime.\n\n\u201cIn the coming months interlinked decisions are also expected on the UK Government\u2019s Comprehensive Spending Review and new Industrial Strategy as well as updated environmental guidelines for oil and gas projects,\u201d OEUK pointed out in the release.\n\n\u201cIn launching its consultations, the government committed to meaningful engagement with industry. OEUK has said this continued engagement is critical to creating the globally competitive business environment needed to anchor high value jobs and investment in the UK,\u201d OEUK added.\n\nIn its report, OEUK noted that UK oil and gas production decline has accelerated over the last five years. The report highlighted that this has averaged nine percent since 2020 but added that it \u201ccan be stemmed\u201d. OEUK\u2019s report outlined that this trend \u201chas been driven both by declining investment in the basin and other destinations proving more attractive\u201d.\n\nOEUK said in the report that the challenge in 2025 is to drive investment back into the UKCS in the face of continued business uncertainty.\n\nIn OEUK\u2019s release, OEUK Chief Executive David Whitehouse said, \u201cthe future of the North Sea is in our hands\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur report shows as we work together to accelerate renewables the UK must make the most of its own oil and gas - or choose to increase reliance on imports. We\u2019re fully engaged with asking policy makers to choose a pragmatic path to the low carbon, high-growth and secure economy we all want to see,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cEnergy security is national security. In an increasingly volatile world the widening gap between the energy we produce and what we import matters. Secure homegrown oil and gas alongside renewables pays taxes, supports jobs and safeguards the supply chains we need to build our energy future,\u201d he continued.\n\nRigzone has contacted the Climate Change Committee, the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), and HM Treasury for comment on OEUK\u2019s release and report. At the time of writing, none of the above have responded to Rigzone.\n\nOEUK describes itself as the leading trade body for the UK\u2019s offshore energies industry. Its membership includes over 400 organizations with an interest in offshore oil, gas, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and offshore wind, OEUK\u2019s release highlighted.\n\nTo contact the author, email andreas.exarheas@rigzone.com",

        "full_text": "Agritech firm Grow Indigo has raised $10 million from British International Investment (BII), the UK\u2019s development finance institution and impact investor. Established in 2018, Grow Indigo is leading the carbon farming revolution with over 2.5 million acres of smallholder farmland already enrolled across seven states. This strategic funding will accelerate the expansion of Grow Indigo\u2019s transformative sustainability programs across India, the company said in a statement.\n\nThe company promotes sustainable techniques such as direct seeded rice and no-tillage farming that deliver multiple benefits such as enhanced soil health and reduced erosion, preservation of biodiversity, improved water efficiency and reduced manual labour particularly benefiting women farmers\n\nThese interventions, which are also known as regenerative agricultural practices, are crucial for decarbonizing rice, wheat and maize production across India.\n\nAgriculture contributes 14 per cent of India\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions\u2014over 400 million tonnes of CO\u2082 annually.\n\nBy encouraging farmers to adopt regenerative agricultural practices, Grow Indigo is creating a revolutionary income stream through soil carbon credits and sustainable produce for Scope 3 reductions. These credits, generated from carbon removals as well as greenhouse gas emissions reductions, are sold to corporations who seek to support resilient agri-food supply chains while meeting their sustainability goals. Majority of carbon credit revenue goes directly to participating farmers, improving their livelihoods.\n\nWith robust measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems, Grow Indigo\u2019s carbon programs offer corporations a transparent, high-impact option to meet sustainability goals while supporting smallholders and creating healthier rural livelihoods. The company also partners with food and fashion companies to facilitate sustainable sourcing and reduce their supply chain emissions.\n\nWith four carbon farming projects at different stages of development and the first carbon credits expected to be issued soon, Grow Indigo is positioned for rapid growth. The company aims to enrol millions of farmers and acres within the next two years.\n\n\u201cRegenerative agriculture is the future of farming, not only for improving soil health, conserving water but also for creating improved livelihoods for millions of smallholder farmers,\u201d said Usha Barwale Zehr, Executive Director of Grow Indigo. \u201cWith this funding, we will accelerate farmer enrolment and scale carbon farming initiatives.\u201d\n\nSrini Nagarajan, Managing Director and Head of Asia at BII, said: \u201cRice, wheat, and maize are staple foods in India, cultivated by numerous smallholder farmers who are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Through our innovative pools of capital, we are proud to support pioneering businesses like Grow Indigo that address adoption barriers by harnessing the potential of carbon markets. This initiative not only reduces carbon emissions but also enhances farmers\u2019 climate resilience and increases their incomes. This is aligned with the Government\u2019s policies to support regenerative agri practices.\u201d\n\nJennifer Kaul, Deputy Director, Investments, South Asia at the British Deputy High Commission in Mumbai, said: \u201cIndia\u2019s strong resolve in the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices is noteworthy. The agricultural sector plays a key role, both for food security and as a valuable export commodity. The UK government is committed to investments that support our climate and sustainability goals, not least in the agricultural sector. British International Investment\u2019s support to Grow Indigo is a welcome step in this direction and reflects the deep partnership between our nations, which is underpinned by growth and sustainability.\u201d",

        "full_text": "Water is essential for life, yet many families are increasingly struggling to access this vital resource. Frequent and prolonged water shortages across various regions are making living conditions unbearable, especially for those in urban areas. The situation is particularly alarming for families with children. Each day begins with the frustrations of not being able to flush toilets, bathe, or cook due to dry taps. Parents who strive to provide for their families now face the fundamental issue of water scarcity.\n\nThe ongoing need to adjust plans based on uncertain water availability adds to the stress of residents, turning what should be a luxury into a basic necessity that is often denied. Although water shortages are not a new issue, their increasing frequency and duration indicate a worsening crisis that demands attention. The menace impacts the quality of life for citizens.\n\nIn various regions, residents may go days or weeks without water from their taps. Urban areas, where self-contained apartments heavily depend on a consistent water supply, are particularly affected. Unlike those in rural areas who can often rely on local sources such as wells or streams, city dwellers are left at the mercy of unpredictable water supplies, usually without any advance warning.\n\nFor parents, this struggle is unimaginable. Children need regular access to water for hygiene practices, from washing their hands to maintaining cleanliness after using the bathroom. The lack of water disrupts daily routines, making it difficult to uphold basic standards of cleanliness and hygiene. The added burden of searching for water compounds the mental strain on caregivers, who must prioritize their children\u2019s needs amid the crisis, especially in households with infants who require water for formula preparation, bottle cleaning, and washing baby clothes.\n\nThe Hidden Consequences of Water Shortages\n\nThe shortage of water entail various hidden costs that adversely affect the finances and well-being of those impacted. Many families have turned to private water vendors, who exploit the situation by charging inflated prices. Once a rarely needed a single drum of water has become a costly necessity for many households. The financial burden of purchasing water regularly adds to the strain of rising living expenses. Those who cannot afford water often spend long periods searching for free or cheaper alternatives, which detracts from their productivity and overall well-being.\n\nThe health risks associated with inadequate water access are significant. Poor sanitation due to insufficient water can lead to severe health issues such as cholera, typhoid, and other waterborne illnesses. The inability to flush toilets, wash hands properly, or clean cooking utensils increases the risk of infections, particularly affecting children who are more vulnerable. Educational institutions and day-care facilities face serious hygiene challenges, raising the risk of disease outbreaks.\n\nAdditionally, hospitals and clinics, which require strict hygiene standards for patient care and medical procedures, struggle to maintain sanitary conditions without a reliable water supply, putting both patients and staff at risk.The crisis in has sparked much debate regarding its causes. Some people attribute it to climate change and decreasing rainfall, while others argue that it largely results from poor management, insufficient investment in infrastructure, and ineffective planning by authorities.\n\nIn recent years, our urban population has grown significantly, yet the water supply infrastructure has not kept pace. Many pipelines and reservoirs in urban centres are outdated, leading to frequent breakdowns and maintenance issues. More so, leaks and burst pipes waste substantial amounts of treated water, further depleting the household supply. The failure to maintain and upgrade water infrastructure has left many communities in distress.\n\nThe Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), which is responsible for water distribution, has repeatedly promised improvements. However, the reality often contradicts these promises. Water rationing schedules, when they are communicated, are rarely followed, leaving residents uncertain about when regular water supply will resume. Many affected communities remain uninformed and confused about the situation they will receive water again. This lack of transparency frustrates citizens.\n\nAddressing the Crisis\n\nIt is crucial to assist communities affected by the water crisis. While occasional maintenance and upgrades are necessary, authorities must ensure that contingency measures are in place to minimize disruptions. It is unreasonable to expect communities to go days without water without an adequate support plan.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nTo effectively tackle the water crisis, a comprehensive strategy is needed that includes improvements to infrastructure, enhanced management practices, and sustainable long-term solutions. The government should make significant investments to modernize and expand the country\u2019s water systems.\n\nCurrent pipelines and treatment plants are often inadequate for the growing demands of urban centres. By investing in new reservoirs, expanding distribution networks, and repairing leaks in existing infrastructure, we can improve the reliability of water supply and reduce wastage.\n\nMoreover, better communication between water authorities and the public is essential. The Ghana Water Company must provide timely and clear updates on water rationing and establish well-defined watering schedules can help residents organize their daily activities. Providing specific information about when water will be available or when interruptions will occur can alleviate frustrations and allow residents to prepare in advance.\n\nWithout effective communication, the situation can become chaotic, leaving citizens in a constant state of uncertainty.Government and private organizations should promote and subsidize water storage tanks and borehole projects, especially in densely populated urban areas where water access is unreliable.\n\nFinally, accountability for poor service must be enforced through strict policies designed to deter corruption and mismanagement in the water sector. Addressing inefficiencies and negligence in managing water resources is crucial for improving service delivery.\n\nConclusion\n\nWater shortages should not be an accepted reality in our country. Without prompt and effective intervention, the situation will only deteriorate, causing further suffering among the populace. The government, water management agencies and community leaders must work together to develop lasting solutions to this urgent issue. Access to clean water is a basic necessity, and it is unacceptable for families to live in fear of when their next water supply will arrive. If authorities do not take decisive action, cities meant to enhance quality of life will instead become places of daily struggle and despair. The time for change is now, because a city without water is not just inconvenient; it is uninhabitable.\n\nWRITTEN BY:\n\nWISDOM KOUDJO KLU,\n\nEDUCATIONIST/COLUMNIST,\n\nGREATER REGION.\n\nWISDOMKLU@GMAIL.COM\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect The Chronicle\u2019s stance.",

        "full_text": "Dublin, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"North America Animal Protein Market Size and Share Analysis - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nThe North America Animal Protein market is expected to reach US$ 3.68 billion by 2033 from US$ 2.38 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 4.95% from 2025 to 2033. The desire for easy protein-rich products, greater understanding of animal-based nutrition, improved farming techniques, rising disposable income, rising meat and dairy consumption, and changing culinary tastes are all driving factors in the North American animal protein market.\n\n\n\nHealth and Nutrition Trends\n\n\n\nvalue of protein for weight management, muscular growth, and general health is becoming more widely acknowledged by consumers as health and wellness consciousness rises. Lean meats, eggs, chicken, and fish are examples of animal proteins that are thought to be necessary for a balanced diet because they include high-quality amino acids that promote immune system function, muscle repair, and metabolic health. Consequently, there is an increased emphasis on eating meals high in protein, particularly those derived from animal sources that are recognized for their full protein profile. This change contributes to the ongoing demand for animal protein and is especially apparent among athletes, fitness fanatics, and people who follow high-protein diets. Furthermore, consumers are choosing healthier protein options like lean cuts and organic meats as they place a higher priority on their health, which propels market expansion.\n\n\n\nRising Disposable Income\n\n\n\nNorth American consumers now have more money to spend on higher-quality animal protein goods, such as premium cuts of meat, organic and grass-fed products, and free-range poultry, thanks to rising disposable income. People are more inclined to spend more for goods that support their ethical and health beliefs when their disposable income increases. Due to their perceived superior quality and sustainability, specialist meat products like hormone-free cattle, antibiotic-free chicken, and wild-caught seafood are also becoming more popular. As customers look to indulge in higher-value food options that offer superior taste, nutritional benefits, and ethical assurances, the ability to buy these premium goods has supported the rise of the North American animal protein market.\n\n\n\nInnovation in Meat Products\n\n\n\nThe need for convenient, health-conscious solutions, and changing customer preferences are driving innovation in the North American animal protein sector. Busy people looking for quick yet wholesome meals are catered to by ready-to-cook and ready-to-eat meat items like marinated cuts, pre-seasoned portions, and meal kits. Furthermore, improvements in processing technology have produced plant-based meat substitutes and protein-enriched meat products that taste and feel like traditional meat products. These developments assist in satisfying the needs of customers who want convenience without compromising their nutritional value. The industry has also seen the emergence of value-added goods, such as meat snacks with functional components and protein-infused snacks, which increase the attractiveness of animal protein by providing extra health benefits like better digestion or increased protein absorption.\n\n\n\nSustainability and Environmental Concerns\n\n\n\nConcern over the effects of animal protein production on the environment has grown, especially in light of greenhouse gas emissions, water use, and deforestation associated with livestock farming. Consumers and environmental groups are urging the business to adopt more sustainable methods as knowledge of climate change rises. This entails promoting improved waste management, more effective feed use, and a lower carbon footprint associated with the production of meat. Companies are therefore under pressure to implement environmentally friendly activities, such purchasing feed that is produced sustainably or making investments in regenerative agricultural methods. Long-term viability depends on these initiatives, but they frequently come at a higher cost, which may be passed on to customers. Consumption habits may be impacted by the higher cost of animal protein sources.\n\n\n\nHealth Implications and Dietary Shifts\n\n\n\nMany consumers are switching to plant-based diets because they believe they are healthier options as they become more aware of the possible health hazards linked to consuming large amounts of animal protein. Plant-based diets are linked to better general health, decreased heart disease risks, and lower cholesterol levels. This change has challenged the commercial dominance of animal protein and fueled the emergence of veganism, vegetarianism, and flexitarianism. The need for non-animal protein sources is being further fueled by the growing popularity of plant-based meat replacements, tofu, and tempeh. This poses a serious problem for the conventional meat business, which must adjust to shifting customer tastes and deal with issues of sustainability, ethical production, and health.\n\n\n\nUnited States Animal Protein Market\n\n\n\nWith high demand for meat, poultry, and seafood goods, the US market for animal protein is still among the biggest in the world. The three main animal protein sources are beef, poultry, and pork. Processed meats like sausages and prepared meals are also becoming more popular. Leaner cuts, organic, grass-fed, and hormone-free alternatives are becoming more and more popular among health-conscious consumers, who are becoming more sensitive of animal welfare and nutrition. Convenience items and meat products with added protein are examples of industry innovations that have kept consumers interested. Animal protein is still a staple of the American diet, despite obstacles from the growth of plant-based diets and worries about sustainability. This is because of a solid supply chain and enduring culinary traditions.\n\n\n\nCanada Animal Protein Market\n\n\n\nWith a robust demand for meat, poultry, and fish, the Canadian animal protein market is a significant sector of the country's food economy. The main sources of animal protein are beef, chicken, and pork, and consumers are becoming more interested in premium cuts, organic, and antibiotic-free goods. Leaner meats and products sourced responsibly are growing more popular among Canadians as they become more health conscious. Additionally, processed meat products like sausages, ready-to-eat meals, and protein-enriched snacks have grown in popularity. However, traditional meat consumption is being challenged by the increase of plant-based diets and environmental concerns, which is forcing manufacturers to innovate and address sustainability. Animal protein is nevertheless a mainstay of the Canadian diet in spite of these obstacles, supported by a robust agricultural sector and changing consumer preferences.\n\n\n\nOntario and Quebec account for about 70% of Canada's milk production. Two markets are supplied by Canadian-produced milk: the industrial milk market and the fluid milk industry, which includes flavored milk, creams, and fluid milk for direct consumption. According to FAS/Canada, total milk output will rise slightly from the 2023 projection of 10.265 million metric tons (MMT) to 10.310 MMT in 2024. The meat processing businesses in Canada produce a broad range of meat products, including processed, smoked, canned, and cooked meats in addition to fresh and frozen meat. Pork is used to make over 70% of processed meats in Canada, including cold cuts and sausages.\n\n\n\nMexico Animal Protein Market\n\n\n\nStrong consumer demand for meat, especially beef, poultry, and pigs, which are essential to traditional Mexican cuisine, is driving the Mexican animal protein market. Because it is inexpensive and can be used in a variety of recipes, poultry in particular has grown in popularity. Although slimmer cuts, organic choices, and hormone-free goods are becoming more popular, beef and pork are still staples due to a growing emphasis on nutrition and health. Another indication of shifting consumer preferences for convenience is the growth of processed meats like sausages and ready-to-cook meals. However, the traditional meat sector faces competition from the growing popularity of plant-based diets, especially in metropolitan areas. Despite these changes, eating animal protein is still a staple of Mexican diets, and demand is only expected to rise due to population growth and culinary customs.\n\nKey Company Analysis\n\nAgropur Dairy Cooperative\n\nAjinomoto Co.

The cyber cell has asked the comedian to appear on March 27 or March 28 for questioning over the controversial statements made by podcaster Ranveer Allahbadia on the show.Maharashtra Cyber Cell recorded the statement of Samay on Monday but he has been called again for questioning by Maharashtra Cyber Cell.Earlier, in his statement, the comedian had expressed his regret on how everything transpired on the show. In his official statement to the authorities, he said, \"I will be careful next time such a thing does not happen again. My mental state is not well due to this whole case. My Canada tour also did not go well. I am sorry for what I said, I know what I said is wrong\".Prior to this, Samay delayed his return to India, and also rescheduled his India tour. The comedian recently took to the Stories section of his Instagram, and shared a note in which he said that he has rescheduled his India tour, and assured the audience of his tour that the the money from their tickets will soon be remitted to the source of their transactions.He wrote, \"Hello guys, I'm rescheduling my India tour. You all will get refunds shortly, see you soon\".The controversy erupted after comments made by Ranveer Allahbadia about parents and sex on comedian Samay Raina's show went viral on social media, sparking widespread backlash.Video evidence shows that Ranveer, a podcaster, said, \"Would you rather watch your parents having sex or join them once and end it forever\".Following public outrage, multiple police complaints were filed against Allahbadia and other people associated with the show in both Mumbai and Guwahati. The cyber cell and the Mumbai police are conducting separate investigations in connection with Allahbadia's remarks on Reina's YouTube show 'India's Got Latent'.",

        "full_text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Today\u2019s post is by Mike Olson. Mike is is an Assistant Professor and Cataloging & Discovery Librarian at Murphy Library, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. His research focuses on the intersection of information systems and social critique.\n\nLibrary catalogs have always been battlegrounds where content is not merely described but debated. President Trump\u2019s January 20, 2025, Executive Order 14172 directing the renaming of longstanding geographical designations \u201cMount Denali\u201d and \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d to the politically loaded \u201cMount McKinley\u201d and \u201cGulf of America\u201d reveal the naked truth of what cataloging has always been: a battlefield where meaning is contested and conquered.\n\nThe Word as Weapon and Shield\n\nWhat makes cataloging such a potent political instrument is not just its ability to name, but its power to make those naming decisions appear neutral and inevitable. Former American Library Association President Emily Drabinski has argued that catalogs don\u2019t merely contain bias \u2014 they systematically disguise that bias behind a facade of technical objectivity.\n\nLet\u2019s not kid ourselves. When the Library of Congress spent decades using \u201cIllegal aliens\u201d as an authorized subject heading \u2014 despite overwhelming evidence of its pejorative nature \u2014 it was exercising power, not objectivity. Librarian Sanford Berman recognized this in 1971 when he published Prejudices and Antipathies: A Tract on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People, documenting how LC headings perpetuated racism, sexism, and xenophobia under the veneer of neutrality.\n\nNow we face a new chapter where language is being weaponized with explicit intent to erase and control. The Trump Administration\u2019s Executive Orders are part of a broader trend of restrictions on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in higher education. These directives are not isolated incidents but reflect a concerted effort to reshape the landscape of American universities. They are part of a broader assault on language that threatens the very foundation of library work. When we can\u2019t speak of certain realities, how do we catalog materials about them? And how will patrons find resources that are not discoverable through keyword searches for now-forbidden terms?\n\nCeleste West and the Revolting Librarians would recognize this moment. In 1972, they exposed how professional \u201cneutrality\u201d served as a shield for complicity with oppressive systems. Their spiritual descendants today face stark choices: comply with linguistic authoritarianism or risk their livelihoods defending intellectual freedom.\n\nToday\u2019s overt politicization strips away that veneer, confirming what critical catalogers have long maintained: neutrality in classification simply doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nBigotry Built Into the System\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that cataloging has always been weaponized against marginalized communities. Consider Melvil Dewey \u2014 whose decimal classification system organizes libraries in 135 countries worldwide. His system relegates women\u2019s issues to domestic subcategories, while centering the experiences of White Christian men as universal. When \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d becomes a minor subdivision and \u201chealth\u201d means men\u2019s health by default, classification performs exactly as its creator intended: marginalizing some voices while naturalizing others.\n\nThe racism in Dewey\u2019s system wasn\u2019t accidental either. His classification placed materials about non-White cultures in ghettoized sections that implied their inferiority to Western civilization. Indigenous knowledge systems were buried under \u201cfolklore\u201d while European philosophy received primary classification status.\n\nThese weren\u2019t neutral technical decisions \u2014 they were expressions of Dewey\u2019s worldview, one that saw White Christian masculinity as the organizing principle of knowledge itself. When today\u2019s directives mandate language changes that center American exceptionalism and erase diverse perspectives, they\u2019re not departing from library tradition. They\u2019re honoring it.\n\nAs recently as 1989, the Dewey Decimal Classification still classed \u201cHomosexuality\u201d under Social Problems, often alongside \u201cProstitution\u201d and \u201cObscenity.\u201d Radical catalogers fought for decades to remove such headings, often facing resistance from traditional cataloging professionals who cited standards preservation, historical continuity, and technical neutrality as reasons to maintain the status quo.\n\nIronically, we now see similar justifications from some of these same professionals when defending the implementation of new politically-charged nationalist terminology mandates. The difference is that while previous classification choices pretended to be objective technical decisions, today\u2019s explicitly political directives have stripped away this facade of neutrality.\n\nThis shift exposes what critical catalogers have argued for generations: subject headings have never been neutral technical metadata but have always functioned as political statements about what deserves recognition and how knowledge should be organized. The new directives don\u2019t introduce politics into cataloging \u2014 they merely make visible the politics that were always there.\n\nLCSH: A Legacy of Problematic Representation\n\nThe Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) system provides a prime example of these embedded politics. Despite being the most widely used subject classification system in the world, LCSH continues to perpetuate marginalization through its controlled vocabulary. While claiming to be a neutral knowledge organization tool, it systematically under-represents the experiences and terminology of marginalized communities, preserves outdated and sometimes offensive language, and structures knowledge in ways that center dominant perspectives. Even after decades of critique and reform efforts, LCSH remains a system where certain voices and experiences receive detailed classification, while others are flattened into broad, often problematic categories \u2014 revealing how institutional power shapes what information is easily discoverable and how communities are represented in our knowledge systems.\n\nConsider how LCSH still employs \u201cSexual minorities\u201d as a collective term for LGBTQ+ people \u2014 phrasing widely considered strange and outdated. The system conflates sex and gender in many headings, using \u201cSex\u201d interchangeably for both \u201cGender (Sex)\u201d and \u201cSex (Gender),\u201d reflecting an institutional failure to acknowledge distinct concepts.\n\nThe gap between LCSH\u2019s representation and contemporary terminology is stark. Rachel K. Fischer\u2019s researchshows that LCSH and Library of Congress Demographic Group Terms (LCDGT) overlap with only about 25% of LGBTQ+ identity terms found in the Homosaurus, a specialized LGBTQ+ vocabulary. This means that three-quarters of the language LGBTQ+ communities use to describe themselves remains unrecognized in our primary national cataloging system.\n\nProgress remains glacial. While some changes have occurred \u2014 \u201cillegal aliens\u201d was eventually replaced with \u201cnoncitizens\u201d \u2014 many problematic headings persist, including \u201cIndians of North America.\u201d This isn\u2019t merely a question of semantic preference; these terminology choices actively obstruct information access for users searching with contemporary language and perpetuate outdated conceptions of marginalized communities.\n\nHope Olson\u2018s The Power to Name: Locating the Limits of Subject Representation in Libraries, published in 2002, exposes how mainstream classification systems marginalize materials about women, people of color, and other non-dominant groups through structural biases in category formation. The current federal directives merely make explicit what Olson proved was always implicit: classification can oppress.\n\nThe Fractured Catalog\n\nThe catalog itself has become schismatic, split between its function as an instrument of state power and its aspiration to facilitate democratic access to knowledge. This duality creates tension within the catalog system. On one hand, it must adhere to standardized classification methods that often reflect societal biases. On the other hand, it strives to be an inclusive repository of knowledge that represents all viewpoints. This split nature of the catalog highlights the ongoing challenge in library science: balancing the need for organization and standardization with the goal of equitable representation and access to diverse knowledge.\n\nWhen catalogers implement politically motivated terminology changes, they become unwilling performers in a linguistic ritual that normalizes certain worldviews while erasing others. But there\u2019s potential for subversion within these systems. Just as Judith Butler identifies how drag performances can expose the constructedness of gender norms, catalogers might employ what we could call \u201cbibliographic drag\u201d \u2014 implementing mandated terminology changes in ways that highlight rather than hide their artificiality.\n\nImagine catalog records where the new term \u201cGulf of America\u201d appears with additional subject headings like \u201cGeographical names\u2013Political aspects\u2013United States\u201d or \u201cExecutive orders\u2013United States\u20132025\u201d revealing its recent provenance and political motivation, turning what was meant as invisible infrastructure into visible commentary.\n\nThis strategy not only enhances discoverability but also turns catalog records into tools for critical engagement with political and social issues.\n\nPower, Knowledge, and Classification\n\nMichel Foucault\u2018s concept of \u201cpower/knowledge\u201d illuminates how control over what can be said is inseparable from control over what can be known. The federal mandates to purge certain words from our catalogs aren\u2019t just linguistic preferences \u2014 they\u2019re attempts to reshape the boundaries of thinkable thought.\n\nWhen we can no longer use \u201cMount Denali\u201d or \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d as subject headings, we\u2019re not just relabeling existing knowledge; we\u2019re restricting which questions can be asked and which connections can be made. The catalog becomes what Foucault called a \u201cdisciplinary apparatus,\u201d training users in government-approved ways of perceiving reality.\n\nThe Invisible Violence of Metadata\n\nWhy should anyone outside library technical services care about catalog politics? What does it matter if the Gulf of Mexico is renamed \u201cGulf of America\u201d in our catalogs?\n\nIt matters because classification violence doesn\u2019t stay confined to metadata records. The language used in knowledge organization systems wield power in shaping how information is accessed, understood, and utilized across societies around the world. When researchers can no longer find resources on \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d because that term has been purged, their research becomes circumscribed by political decree rather than intellectual curiosity. When historical materials about \u201cMount Denali\u201d are reclassified under \u201cMount McKinley,\u201d we witness the real-time rewriting of history through bibliographic means.\n\nThe violence isn\u2019t merely symbolic. Changes in cataloging language can affect how marginalized groups are represented and how easily information about these communities can be found. If future federal decrees replace terms like \u201creproductive rights\u201d with politically motivated euphemisms, healthcare researchers will no longer be able to efficiently locate materials and clinical practice will suffer. If climate scientists\u2019 work becomes harder to discover because standard terminology has been obfuscated, policy responses will lag. Cataloging decisions made today determine what knowledge remains accessible tomorrow.\n\nThis connects to what philosopher Miranda Fricker terms \u201cepistemic injustice\u201d \u2014 the harm done to individuals and communities in their capacity as knowers. When the language communities use to describe their own experiences is systematically excluded from knowledge organization systems, they must translate their realities into government-approved terminology or risk invisibility.\n\nMake no mistake: what begins as cataloging politics inevitably becomes thought control. By controlling what can be named, authorities control what can be known, taught, researched, and ultimately imagined as possible.\n\nBeyond Resistance: Reimagining Authority\n\nThe current crisis forces us to confront fundamental questions about authority in cataloging. If official vocabulary sources can be weaponized against intellectual freedom, perhaps the problem isn\u2019t just which terms are authorized but the concept of authorization itself.\n\nWhat might cataloging look like if it embraced what Shannon Mattern calls \u201cintellectual infrastructure\u201d \u2014 systems designed not to enforce singular meanings but to facilitate multiple interpretations? What if catalog records functioned less like pronouncements from authority and more like conversations among different ways of knowing?\n\nThe technological tools already exist. Faceted classification allows users to approach information from multiple entry points rather than following a predetermined hierarchy. Linked data models can explicitly represent relationships between different naming conventions, preserving both mandated terminology and community-preferred language while making the power relationships between them visible. User-generated tagging systems, when implemented alongside controlled vocabularies, create spaces where community knowledge can thrive even when official language fails.\n\nLibraries like the Xwi7xwa Library at the University of British Columbia demonstrate how alternative classification systems can center Indigenous perspectives rather than marginalizing them. Their adaptation of the Brian Deer Classification shows how knowledge organization can emerge from the communities it serves rather than being imposed from above. Similarly, the Homosaurus international linked data vocabulary provides a model for how community-developed terminologies can exist alongside institutional systems, offering pathways to discovery that LCSH alone cannot provide.\n\nDigital humanities projects like the Early Caribbean Digital Archive implement reparative cataloging, explicitly addressing the colonialist assumptions embedded in traditional metadata by incorporating marginalized perspectives and contested terminologies. These examples show that the obstacle isn\u2019t technical but conceptual \u2014 we remain bound to a professional ideology that equates standardization with access, even when standardization actively impedes access to certain kinds of knowledge.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean abandoning organization or embracing chaos. It means reconceiving authority as emerging from communities rather than being imposed upon them. It means classification systems that acknowledge their situatedness rather than pretending universality. It means catalogs that preserve the history of terminological changes rather than silently implementing them.\n\nPractically, this could take the form of multi-layered catalogs where government-mandated terminology exists alongside community-preferred language, with transparent pathways between them. It might involve explicit documentation of terminological shifts within catalog records themselves, turning metadata into a site for critical engagement rather than passive acceptance. It could mean developing consortial approaches where libraries collectively implement alternative access points when official terminology becomes compromised.\n\nAs we watch language and library catalogs transform under political pressure, we\u2019re experiencing the logical conclusion of a cataloging philosophy that has always prioritized authority over pluralism and standardization over justice. The current crisis isn\u2019t a departure from library tradition but its culmination\u2014the moment when the violence always hidden within our classification systems becomes impossible to ignore.\n\nIf we take anything positive from this moment, perhaps it\u2019s the opportunity to reimagine cataloging from the ground up. Not as a disciplinary apparatus that enforces authorized meanings, but as an emancipatory practice that connects users to information through multiple linguistic pathways. Not as a technology of control, but as an infrastructure of possibility.\n\nThe revolting librarians would accept nothing less. Neither should we.",
