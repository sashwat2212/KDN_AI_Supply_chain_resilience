        "full_text": "Although first three-quarters' growth was not too promising with 6.2 percent in Dec quarter - it was somewhat expected since it was an election year, explains Dr Rumki Majumdar (PhD), economist at Deloitte.\n\nShe speaks about the current volatility in the financial market and deconstructs to explain what it reflects on the fundamentals of economy. She is optimistic about the long-term prospects of India\u2019s growth. She also explains the reasons for which she thinks that FMCG, renewables, auto, defence and semiconductors are likely to do well in the near future.\n\nEdited Excerpts: India\u2019s economy grew at 6.2 percent in Q3 FY25. Do you think this is good growth to meet long term target of government? Growth in the first three quarters has been, on average, 6.1 per cent year-on-year\u2014a slowdown which is somewhat expected given that this year has been the election year. Besides uncertainties around the US elections, higher than normal yet spatial rainfall, and geopolitical events have pressured trade and investments.\n\nBy the way, though growth may seem to be slowing, the higher base effect (as growth was revised up to 9.2 percent in FY24) is causing the current numbers to appear modest.\n\nThere are times when growth and markets do not tally with each other but in the long run they are supposed to go together. What are your views on the current scenario? The current turmoil in the market is an outcome of global uncertainties and disruption to trade and investment prospects. The turmoil is not a reflection of India\u2019s economic fundamentals, which remain strong. Global uncertainties always weigh on investors\u2019 sentiments, leading to a capital flight to safer investment destinations. If you look at the corporate profits, they did well in the third quarter.\n\nSeveral high-frequency data such as GST, FMCG growth, IP, and inflation numbers point to a rebounding economy. Once investors factor in the uncertainties in their decision-making, India will emerge as an attractive destination for its strong domestic demand, large consumer base, and robust manufacturing capabilities and services sector performance.\n\nFinancial markets are currently down around 16 percent from their peaks. What is your future outlook of the market in view of the country\u2019s overall market growth? The market for the next few months will remain volatile as the trade landscape continues to evolve, impacting the global supply chain, global growth, and inflation. If the US sees higher inflation, the US Fed may go for fewer rate cuts, which again will impact global liquidity and investment appetite.\n\nHaving said that, India\u2019s long-term prospects are very strong. Besides, the government is proactively engaging in bold reforms and initiatives to support growth and cushion the impact of trade uncertainties.\n\nOnce the uncertainty dust settles and we know where trade policies in the West are headed, our market will attract investments, and our outlook will improve.\n\nHow is the Indian economy doing in comparison to other economies? India is the fastest-growing economy amid uncertainties, and the recent drop in inflation numbers assures that the growth comes with more stability as well. CAD (current account deficit) is the lowest in a decade, and our fiscal deficit is down from 9.2% of GDP during COVID-19 year to 4.8% this FY. Clearly, we have improved our economic fundamentals steadily. That said, there is scope to improve. We need to adhere to fiscal consolidation and reduce deficit as well as keep inflation under check.\n\nOur biggest advantage is the demographic dividend and growing middle class. 40 per cent of NSE investors in the Indian stock market are under 30 years old, highlighting the confidence Indian youth have in Indian capital markets.\n\nIn the Budget, income tax rates were reduced and a lot of emphasis was made on job creation. Do you think enough is being done on job creation? On the employment front, job creation will have to be shouldered primarily by the private sector. While capex spending and a boost to consumption can spur employment, it will be the private sector, which needs to step up and invest, which can lead to employment generation.\n\nMoreover, with technology-driven job creation, the government's role will be to build an upskilling infrastructure, guaranteeing workforce readiness and inclusive technology adoption. This will ensure that technology's benefits reach all levels of the job value chain.\n\nWhich are the sectors that are likely to do well in the near and medium-term future? In the short run, a boost in consumption will likely help the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) sector. The auto sector will also do well, particularly at the entry and mid-segment levels.\n\nIn the longer run, the renewables sector is being massively pushed, and demand for energy is on the rise due to rising demand for mobility and technology. India\u2019s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint will be another factor.\n\nWe also believe defence and semiconductors will see huge investment inflows due to global developments as the government will prioritise self-reliance in critical sectors. Rising digitisation demand and the rising opportunity for the servicification of manufacturing will push growth in the services sector, which is where India has a comparative advantage."

        "full_text": "Mounting research shows birds have been disappearing at a staggering rate since the 1970s due to our rapidly changing climate, sparking concerns among nature lovers and bird watchers.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nAs Cleveland.com reported, residents in Northeast Ohio have noticed fewer birds visiting their backyards in recent years. Rising temperatures are likely a major culprit, as warmer weather makes it harder for birds to find insects when they return from winter migration.\n\nWith hotter springtime weather in the northern U.S., insects hatch sooner than usual, and birds arriving from the south miss their chance to find easy food sources. When fall and winter come back around, some birds may not even migrate because it's not cold enough, disrupting their natural survival instincts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Science and shared by Cornell University, the North American bird population has decreased by nearly 3 billion in just 50 years. Since 1970, forests have lost 1 billion birds, while more than 720 million birds have disappeared from grasslands.\n\nThe research also found that aerial insectivores \u2014 birds such as swallows, nighthawks, and flycatchers \u2014 have declined by 32%. Coastal shorebird populations have fallen by one-third as well.\n\nCornell said some of the main species affected are common birds including blackbirds, warblers, finches, snowbirds, and Eastern and Western Meadowlarks.\n\nWhile our warming planet likely contributes the most to declining bird populations, other reasons for their disappearance include habitat loss, pesticide use, and collisions with power lines and other infrastructure.\n\nWhy are disappearing birds concerning?\n\nBirds are an important part of healthy ecosystems worldwide, as they eat insects that grow in our gardens, pollinate wildflowers and foods we enjoy such as bananas and nutmeg, and disperse seeds. Having fewer birds in our backyards is not just a depressing prospect, but it could also threaten food security and lead to increased pest issues.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, the sheer number of birds disappearing indicates a larger biodiversity crisis, as our warming world impacts every species in some way. The fact that two-thirds of North American birds are at risk of extinction, as the National Audubon Society reported, is a major concern.\n\nWhat's being done about declining bird populations?\n\nCleveland.com suggested leaving foods such as winterberry and other berries out for birds in the fall and winter and keeping your yard a bit messy so that birds have sources of seeds if they stop by.\n\nSome birds have made a major comeback recently, including Siberian cranes in China and Russia and turtle doves in the United Kingdom. Conservation efforts in remote islands in the South Atlantic Ocean have also saved one of the world's rarest birds, a yellow finch called the Wilkins' bunting.\n\nWe can ensure the survival of our feathered friends by planting native flowers that will attract birds and controlling pests without chemicals.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

Read our privacy policy\n\nSports broadcaster Anita Jones, 34, says she spent years feeling \"gaslit\" by doctors who dismissed her excruciating pain, telling her \"nothing was wrong\".\n\nThe CBS Sports and Premier League presenter finally received surgery last year for endometriosis, a debilitating condition affecting one in 10 women and those assigned female at birth in the UK.\n\nJones's experience highlights a concerning lack of awareness and understanding surrounding endometriosis. Despite being a common gynaecological condition, impacting individuals from puberty to menopause, Endometriosis UK reports that only half of young adults in the UK recognise the disease.\n\nWorryingly, many healthcare professionals, including GPs and A&E doctors, also fail to identify its symptoms.\n\nEndometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the womb lining grows elsewhere in the body. Responding to menstrual cycle hormones, these cells cause inflammation, pain, and scarring.\n\nopen image in gallery Anita Jones has worked as a sports broadcaster for many years ( April Alexander Photography )\n\nJones, who has also been a Sky Sports and BBC Sports presenter, first went to the doctors for painful periods at the age of 14.\n\n\u201cMy periods were extremely heavy and I could never concentrate in school. When I went to the doctors they told me girls can just have painful periods and nothing was wrong,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAs I got older, I wasn\u2019t just having pain when bleeding. I was having pelvic pain for at least two to three weeks of the month.\u201d\n\nMarch marks Endometriosis Action Month, and the charity says those with the condition face an average of nearly nine years before receiving a diagnosis.\n\nJones found some relief when she was prescribed the contraceptive pill at the age of 18, but by 26 the effects had worn off.\n\nThe following year, the Londoner came across a post online about someone else\u2019s endometriosis diagnosis.\n\n\u201cShe had listed all of these symptoms such as painful periods, pelvic pain and being extremely tired all the time. I identified with 90% of the things she had been living with\u201d\n\nJones went to see a doctor immediately. \u201cI told her I wanted to be referred to a gynaecologist \u2013 I wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer this time.\n\nopen image in gallery \u2018After years of being told nothing was wrong with me, for once I had felt like I had a voice\u2019 ( April Alexander Photography )\n\n\u201cAfter years of being told nothing was wrong with me, for once I had felt like I had a voice.\u201d\n\nThen followed nine months of scans and laparoscopic surgery before finally being diagnosed with endometriosis when she was 28 years old.\n\n\u201cI remember asking the anaesthetist if they found anything when I woke up from surgery,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThey did and I remember being in floods of tears. I had been gaslit for so long.\u201d\n\nAt that stage the doctors had found endometriosis on the right side of Jones\u2019 bowel and on her abdominal wall \u2013 which they would need to remove. To help with the pain she had a contraceptive coil fitted.\n\n\u201cGetting the coil [fitted] felt like a bomb [had] exploded inside me, but after six months it changed and for the first time in my life I felt like those girls that say they don\u2019t really have any issues with their period.\u201d\n\nThe relief was short lived though and six months later she was advised take a nasal spray to suppress her hormones, in an attempt to trick her body into thinking it has gone into menopause.\n\n\u201cI went through all the menopausal symptoms for six weeks with no sleep and intense sweating.\u201d\n\nJones finally had surgery in May 2024, at a private hospital, after the endometriosis had spread to the outside of her womb, causing her large intestine to stick to it \u2013 and the organs had to be separated.\n\n\u201cAlthough they have got rid of everything, which is great, my life since then has been a real shadow of itself,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI\u2019m a very active person and I\u2019m still not fully recovered.\n\n\u201cI have physio every once or two weeks. I have assistance at work and even airports. I can\u2019t walk long distances or carry heavy things. It is getting better but its approaching 10 months of recovery now.\u201d\n\nJones \u2013 now an ambassador for Endometriosis UK \u2013 is keen to make sure young girls are taught the difference between a normal period and what endometriosis is.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a 14-year-old girl, you are already going through so many changes in your body. I didn\u2019t even have the vocabulary to express myself.\n\n\u201cNow as a grown woman, I have needed therapy. I didn\u2019t anticipate my recovery would take this long and some days are challenging to the point I just think, What is the point in going to work or doing anything because I\u2019m in so much pain?\u201d\n\nJones says she\u2019s now \u201cvery open\u201d talking about her diagnosis at work.\n\n\u201cI will always take my small hot water bottle and painkillers with me to the grounds when I\u2019m working at matches. I really don\u2019t care and I will openly tell people if I\u2019m having a bad day.\n\n\u201cSo often people will look at me and think I\u2019m OK because I\u2019ll go to work and show up and they can\u2019t fathom there is something wrong with me. Sometimes I feel like I have to justify why I need assistance or if I\u2019m walking slowly.\n\nShe says: \u201cTo any woman who feels like something is not OK with her body, I would say push to see a gynaecologist. Listen to that inner voice.\n\n\u201cWe need to talk about periods. We are all here and alive because women have periods. If you\u2019re not going to talk about that and look into it, we are doing young girls such a huge disservice.\u201d"

        "full_text": "\u201cThis is for Gaza\u201d MP Shockat Adam has been challenged after using a Westminster debate on Israel to make unsubstantiated claims about alleged secret deals between the UK and the IDF.\n\nThe Independent MP for Leicester South was granted a Westminster Hall debate on Military Cooperation With Israel on Tuesday at which he appeared to suggest the RAF aircraft were involved in delivering UK equipment, including \u201cmilitary vehicles and helicopters\u201d from its airbase in Cyprus to assist the IDF in its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAt one stage Adam, the brother of Friends of Al Aqsa founder Ismail Patel, accused the UK government of allowing \u201cIsraeli exceptionalism\u201d which was undermining \u201cthe very concept of international law itself.\u201d\n\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nOutlining widely circulated claims with the pro-Palestine movement, Adam told MPs \u201cthere is now mounting suspicion and evidence that UK facilities in Gibraltar are being used for the facilitation of armed shipments, harbour services, and jet fuel supplies for vessels transporting weapons from the US to Israel. \u201d\n\nHe claimed: \u201cOur military co-operation extends beyond arms sales; it is operational, especially when it comes to using our airbase in Akrotiri, Cyprus. In one year alone, from December 2023 to November 2024, the UK conducted 645 surveillance and recon missions, which amounts to almost two flights a day.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, during the same period, the US moved heavy transport aircraft carrying military equipment to Akrotiri, and the RAF subsequently conducted daily cargo flights from Akrotiri to Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cWe have been told that those flights were for surveillance and hostage rescue, but if that is the case, we must ask why we used RAF Atlas C1 aircraft, which are large enough to transport military vehicles and helicopters. \u201d\n\nHe also made further unproven claims about the use of F-35 fighter jets in Gaza.\n\nArmed Forces minister Luke Pollard later confirmed the RAF has conducted unarmed surveillance flights over the eastern Mediterranean, including in airspace over Israel and Gaza.\n\nBut he added: \u201cI reassure honorary Members, because a number of them raised this point, that these flights are solely in support of hostage rescue.\u201d\n\nLabour MP Luke Akehurst also repeatedly challenged Adam over his unsubstantiated claims.\n\nThe North Durham MP noted that the government had last year \u201cintroduced arms export licence suspensions, which target any weapons that might be of British origin that would be used in Gaza, but are attempting to balance that with the needs of the IDF to defend itself against acts of aggression\u2014for instance, the Iranian missile attacks in other theatres in which the IDF is operating.\u201d\n\nAkehurst addressed Adam\u2019s allegation about RAF collaboration with the IDF in Gaza urged him to recognise \u201cthat in the unlikely event that RAF transport aircraft had been carrying something as large as a helicopter or a military vehicle from Cyprus to Israel \u2013 it is the first time I have heard that allegation \u2013 we might have seen evidence of such helicopters or military vehicles of British provenance?\n\n\u201cThe Israel Defence Forces have no need of such equipment. They have far more equipment than the British armed forces do.\u201d\n\nIn relation to claims over F-35s, Akehurst added: \u201cIt is more likely that F-35s were in use to shoot down Iranian drones, cruise missiles and other projectiles that were fired at Israel. Israel needs to use that platform to defend itself, given that it has faced two of the largest barrages of weapons fired at civilian targets since World War Two.\u201d\n\nThe Independent MP, who famously dedicated his general election victory in Leicester South to the people of Gaza last July, received support in the debate from MPs including Labour left-wingers Andy McDonald and Scottish Labour\u2019s Brian Leishman, and from Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThe Blackburn independent MP Adnan Hussain at one point suggested that the UK \u201callying with Israel while it carries out a genocide will bring about the end of the international world order as we know it.\u201d\n\nAdam responded: \u201cThe UK helped to build the modern international legal order, but we risk dismantling it today. International law is not a game of pick and mix, where we enforce it in one case \u2014namely African despots\u2014and ignore it in another. By allowing Israeli exceptionalism, we threaten to undermine the very concept of international law itself.\u201d\n\nLater, Conservative MP Mark Francois intervened to say: \u201cWhile I can understand the passion articulated by the Member for Leicester South in this debate, I say to him most respectfully that he is able to make those arguments in a democratic forum and publicly criticise the Government of the day because he is fortunate to live in a parliamentary democracy. That is not something we can say of all the countries in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nOffered the opportunity to address MPs in greater detail, Akehurst said: \u201cThe military cooperation between the UK and Israel helps to keep our country safe.\n\n\u201cOver decades, Britain and Israel have conducted joint military exercises in areas such as counter-terrorism, cyber-security and defence technology. British troops have been kept safe thanks to cooperation with Israel\u2019s cutting-edge defence sector, particularly in unmanned aerial vehicles, missile defence and radar systems. The UK and Israel share intelligence on counter-terrorism and security threats posed by Iran, ISIS and other malign actors, both in the Middle East and at home.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is my understanding that the surveillance flights are actually collecting intelligence relating to the hostages in Gaza, including Avinatan Or, whose mother is British and who has now been held captive for 528 days.\n\n\u201cI hope the minister will update us today on whether the UK will continue those surveillance flights and do everything we can to bring Avinatan home.\u201d\n\nResponding for the government, Armed Force minister Luke Pollard said UK \u201cshares an important, long-standing and broad strategic partnership with the state of Israel. \u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOur defence partnership with Israel aims to support the security of an important partner and reduce tensions in the wider region.\n\n\u201cIt incorporates a range of defence engagement activity, including defence education, joint training and capability development \u2026 the role our RAF played in thwarting Iran\u2019s co-ordinated missile and drone attack on Israel in April 2024, and again in October 2024, demonstrates our commitment to Israel\u2019s security and to de-escalating regional tensions.\n\n\u201cAs the House has been updated previously, in the aftermath of the shocking attacks on 7 October, the RAF has conducted unarmed surveillance flights over the eastern Mediterranean, including in airspace over Israel and Gaza.\n\n\u201cI reassure honorary Members, because a number of them raised this point that these flights are solely in support of hostage rescue.\n\n\u201cOnly information related to hostage rescue can be passed to the relevant authority for hostage rescue. We will pass information only if we are satisfied that it will be used in accordance with international humanitarian law.\n\n\u201cAs in the past, and as with other nations, any future defence activity with Israel will be subject to a rigorous overseas security and justice assistance assessment to assess compliance with human rights obligations and international humanitarian law.\n\n\u201cAlthough we recognise and respect Israel\u2019s right to defend itself following 7 October, and condemn the brutal attacks by Hamas in the strongest possible terms, we have had, and continue to have, concerns about Israel\u2019s conduct. \u201d\n\nPollard added: \u201cWe are clear that the remaining hostages must be released, and the way to return them safely is through a deal. All parties, including Israel, must observe international humanitarian law. \u201d"

        "full_text": "As funding and building a business gets harder, takes longer and becomes more complex, startup founders need VCs to be a true partner on their growth journey.\n\nStartup investing in 2024/25 is a different ballgame to a few years ago when funding was plentiful and rapid growth curves were the norm. Deals are still happening and there are still exciting businesses out there, but VCs are a lot pickier about who they back, and potential customers are much tougher to convince.\n\nNatural selection means the best founders are rising to the top, while others are falling by the wayside. The same goes for VCs, as the most talented founders work hard to ensure they have the best partner for the journey. Increasingly they are signing not with big asset managers or corporate VCs, but with smaller, scrappier entrepreneurially minded investors, who can add real value to the business.\n\nA spectrum of VCs\n\nVCs vary widely in their background and approach. At one end of the scale are the more traditional asset manager-style funds, with a hands-off approach. These investors can achieve huge success in a buoyant market and there are still plenty of them around, writing big cheques. But, as the market has turned, founders are looking for more support and input, and a different mindset. Entrepreneurial VCs who take an \u2018activist\u2019 approach are coming into their own.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a wave of these types of VCs in recent years. On the one hand, you have funds set up by ex-entrepreneurs such as QuantumLight, founded by Revolut CEO Nik Storonsky, Plural, started by Taavet Hinrikus of Transferwise, and Cherry Ventures, built by founders from Zalando, Spotify, and Uber. On the other, some investors combine more traditional finance experience with a founder mindset, operating at the seed end of the market with a scrappy, small team. They\u2019re on the same wavelength as startups and looking to take an active role in building businesses, alongside founders.\n\nIt\u2019s the latter two VC models that are coming to the fore, for three main reasons.\n\nMore experienced founders are demanding more\n\nBuilding a business now isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted, which is why serial founders are dominating the startup space. Having been there and done it before, they have the confidence to navigate the headwinds and attract funding. According to Pitchbook, in 2023 serial founders attracted 2.5 times more participation from the top 100 investors to first-time entrepreneurs.\n\nThese founders are well-connected individuals who know what they want from their VC partner and, in some cases, have learned the hard way what does and doesn\u2019t work. Consequently, it makes sense that they want to partner with funds with a similar mindset, who will provide valuable contacts, advice, and hands-on support when needed.\n\nLonger hold periods\n\nAnother knock-on effect of the tougher climate is that building businesses takes longer. A few years ago, the best founders could be confident of growing fast and fundraising regularly, providing opportunities to refresh the cap table. Nobody expects the market to return to those highs soon, meaning that founders could be with the same investors for 10 or even 15 years. Pitchbook data found the average lifespan of VC and private equity funds is now 13.1 years.\n\nWith that in mind, startups are approaching investor due diligence with a longer-term mindset, asking who is going to help them navigate a tough and unpredictable few years, and who they can have the most productive, constructive, and enjoyable relationship with. The answer is invariably the investor who treats the founder like a partner, rather than purely an investment.\n\nMore complex businesses\n\nFinally, startups are becoming both more complex from a technology perspective, and more niche in the problems they are solving. All the low-hanging fruit has been harvested and the most promising ideas now invariably involve B2B challenges, deep tech, or identifying or developing use cases for AI.\n\nNot only do these businesses, by definition, take longer to build \u2013 see above \u2013 but they are also more likely to benefit from investors with a background in their sector or technology niche. VC funds comprising ex-entrepreneurs and sector or technology specialists offer much more than just cash, and for these founders, choosing between them and a large asset management style firm is a no-brainer.\n\nJumping off a cliff\n\nThere is a famous quote from Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn: \u2018Entrepreneurs jump off a cliff and build parachutes on their way down.\u2019\n\nLarge hands-off VC funds will always have a place in the startup ecosystem, particularly in the later rounds, where businesses need less day-to-day support. The outsized power of these funds will also continue as long as governments and institutional LPs prioritise them when allocating funds. But my prediction is that the most exciting and sustainable businesses from this vintage will be those in which VCs are right there on the cliff with their founder partners - and ready to jump."

The trio of rulings came within hours of an extraordinary conflict, as President Donald Trump called for the impeachment of another judge who had temporarily blocked deportation flights. Trump's message drew a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nClimate United Fund and other groups had sued the EPA, Zeldin and Citibank, saying they had illegally denied the groups access to $14 billion awarded last year through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, commonly referred to as a \u201cgreen bank.\" The program was created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects.\n\nClimate United and two other groups, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities, said the freeze not only prevented them from financing new projects, but might force them to lay off staff.

        "full_text": "Surfing YouTube, I came across an interview of Ezra Klein by Stephen Colbert. He was promoting a new book called Abundance, basically arguing that scarcity is politically-manufactured by \u201cboth sides,\u201d and that if we get our political act together, everybody can have more. Planetary limits need not apply. I\u2019ve often been impressed by Klein\u2019s sharp insights on politics, yet can\u2019t reconcile how someone so smart misses the big-picture perspectives that grab my attention.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone: tons of sharp minds don\u2019t seem to be at all concerned about planetary limits or metastatic modernity, which for me has been a source of perennial puzzlement.\n\nThe logical answer is that I\u2019m not the sharpest tool in the shed. Indeed, many of these folks could run cognitive/logical circles around me. And maybe that\u2019s the end of the story. Yet it\u2019s not the end of this post, as I try to work out what accounts for the disconnect, and (yet again) examine my own assuredness.\n\nImagined Basis\n\nWhat is the basis of pundit-level rejection of my premise? Oh yeah: my premise is that modernity is a fleeting, patently unsustainable mode of life on Earth that will self-terminate on a historically relevant (i.e., brief) timescale\u2014likely to convincingly crest the peak this century. Modernity can\u2019t last.\n\nI will reconstruct how I think an ultra-smart person might react, were I to present in conversation the premise that modernity can\u2019t last\u2014based on past interactions with such folks. Two branches stand out.\n\nOne branch would be the unwittingly spot-on admission of \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d I could not have identified the core problem any better, and would be tempted to say: \u201cWow\u2014what a courageous first step in recognizing our limited faculties. That humble confession is very big of you.\u201d My not having the wit to prove conclusively to such folks that modernity can\u2019t work (and I would say that no human possesses such mental powers) says very little about the complex reality of our future\u2014operating without giving a flip as to what happens in human brains. But it\u2019s also quite far from demonstrating convincingly how something as unsustainable as modernity\u2014dependent on one-time exploitation of non-renewable resources\u2014might possibly address the host of interacting elements that will contribute to its crumbling.\n\nThat branch aside, the common reply I want to spend more time on goes something like: \u201cJust look at the past. No one could have foreseen the amazingness of today, and we ought to recognize that we are likewise ill-equipped to speculate on the future. In other words, anyone expressing your premise in the last 10,000 years would have turned out to be wrong [well, so far]. Chances, are: so are you.\u201d\n\nDamn. Blistering. How can one get up from that knockout? And the thing is, it\u2019s a completely valid bit of logic . I also appreciate the intellectual humility involved. Why, then, am I so stubborn on this point? Is it because I want to be popular or rich? Then I\u2019m even stupider than I thought, because those things are basically guaranteed to be incompatible with such a message. Is it because I crave end-times, having been dealt a bad hand and never \u201cgood at the game?\u201d Nope: I thrived as an all-in astrophysicist and had/have a rather privileged and comfortable life that I would personally, selfishly prefer not to have disrupted. Is it out of fear of collapse? Getting warmer: that was a big early motivation\u2014the alarming prospect of losing what I held until recently to be a glorious civilization. But at this point all I can say is that based on multiple lines of evidence I really think it\u2019s the truth, and can\u2019t easily or honestly argue myself out of this difficult spot. Denial, anger, bargaining, and depression don\u2019t help us come to terms with the hard reality..\n\nReturning to the putative response: I\u2019ll name it as lazy. It\u2019s superficial. It\u2019s a shortcut, sidling up to: \u201cCollapse hasn\u2019t happened yet\u2014in fact quite the opposite\u2014and thus most likely will not.\u201d It declines to examine the constituent pieces and arguments, falling back on a powerful and persuasive bit of logic straight out of the left brain. It has all the hallmarks: certain, crisp, abstract, decontextualized, logical, clever.\n\nIt carries the additional dual advantage of simultaneously avoiding unpleasant confrontation of a scary prospect and inviting starry-eyed wonder at magic the future might bring. No wonder it\u2019s so magnetically attractive as a go-to response!. We\u2019re both driven to it and attracted by it! The very smartest among us, in fact, often have the most to lose, and may therefore be among the most psychologically attached to modernity. We mustn\u2019t forget that every human has a psychology, and is capable of impressive levels of denial for any number of reasons.\n\nSome Metaphors\n\nIts time for a few metaphors that help to frame my approach. I offer two related ones, because none are perfect. Together, they might work well enough for our purposes.\n\nTake One\n\nImagine that someone tees up a golf ball in an indoor space full of hard objects: concrete walls and steel shelves\u2014maybe loaded with heavy glass goblets and vases, etc. Poised to deliver a smashing blow to the ball with an over-sized driver, they ask me: \u201cWhat do you think will happen if I hit this ball?\u201d Imagining a comical movie scene where the ball makes a series of wild-ass bounces shattering priceless collectables as it goes, it might seem impossible to guess what all might or might not happen. So, I \u201ccheat\u201d and say: \u201cThe ball will come to rest.\u201d\n\nAnd guess what: I\u2019m right! No matter how crazy the flight, it is guaranteed that in fairly short order, the ball will no longer be moving. I could even put a timescale on it: stopped within 10 seconds, or maybe even 5\u2014depending on the dimensions of the room. I can say this because each collision will remove a fair bit of energy from the ball, and the smaller the room, the shorter the time between energy-sapping events.\n\nDuring the middle of the experiment, it is clear that mayhem is happening, and it\u2019s essentially impossible to predict what\u2019s next. That\u2019s where we are in modernity. So, yes: some intellectual humility is called for. We could not have predicted any of the particulars, after all. But one can still stand by the prediction that the ball will come to rest, much as one can say modernity will wind itself down.\n\nTake Two\n\nThe golf ball metaphor does 80% of the work, but I don\u2019t fully embrace it because the ball is at maximum destructive capacity at the very beginning, its damage-potential decaying from the first moment. Modernity took some time to accelerate to present speed, now at a fever pitch. For this, I think of a rock tumbling down a slope.\n\nI do a fair bit of hiking, sometimes off trail where\u2014careful as I am\u2014I might occasionally dislodge a rock on a steep slope. What happens next is entirely unpredictable (even if deterministic given initial conditions). Most of the time the rock just slides just a few centimeters; sometimes it will lazily tumble a few meters; or more rarely it will pick up speed and hurtle hundreds of meters down the slope in a kinetic spectacle. Kilometer scales are not entirely out of the question in some locations.\n\nStill, for all these scenarios, I am sure of one thing: the rock will come to rest\u2014possibly in multiple fragments. I can also put a reasonable timescale on it, mid-journey, based on its behavior to that point. I can tell if it\u2019s picking up speed. I can evaluate if the slope is moderating or will soon come to an end. It\u2019s not impossible to make a decent guess for how long it might go, even if unable to predict what hops, collisions, or deflections it might execute along the way.\n\nMaybe the phrase \u201ca rolling stone gathers no moss\u201d can be re-interpreted as: kinetic mayhem is no basis for a healthy, relational ecology. If tumbling boulders were the normal/default state of things, mountains would not last long (or more to the point: never come into being!). Likewise, one species driving millions of others to extinction in mere centuries is not a normal, sustainable state of affairs. That $#!+ has to stop.\n\nModernity\u2019s Turn\n\nModernity is far more complex than a tumbling rock. But one side effect of this is a multitude of facets to consider. When many of them line up to tell a similar story\u2026well, that story becomes more compelling. I offer a few, here.\n\nPopulation\n\nGlobal human population has been a super-exponential, in that the annual growth rate as a percentage of the total has steadily climbed through the millennia and centuries (0.04% after agriculture began, up to 2% in the 1960s). It is no shock to anyone that we may be straining (or overtaxing) what the planet can support. Indeed, the growth rate has been decreasing for the last 60 years, and the drop appears to be accelerating lately. Almost any model predicts a global peak before this century is over, and possibly as soon as the next 15\u201320 years. This is, of course, highly relevant to modernity. Economies will shrink and possibly collapse (being predicated on growth) as population falls from a peak. Such a turn could precipitate a whole new phase that \u201cno one could have seen coming.\u201d I\u2019m looking at you, pundits!\n\nThe argument of \u201cjust look to the past\u201d and imagining some sort of extrapolation begins to seem dubious or even outright silly in the context of a plummeting population. Let\u2019s face it: we don\u2019t know how it plays out. Loss of modern technological capabilities is not at all a mental stretch, even if such \u201cmuscles\u201d are rarely exercised.\n\nResources\n\nModernity hungry!. Fossil fuels have played a huge role in the dramatic acceleration of the past few centuries. We all know this is a limited-time prospect. Oil discoveries peaked over a half-century ago, so the writing is on the wall for production decline on a timescale of decades. Pretending that solar and wind will sweep in as substitutes involves a fair bit of magical thinking and ignorance of myriad practical details (back to the \u201cI don\u2019t see why not\u201d response). We face an unprecedented transition as fossil fuels wane, so that the acceleration of the past is very likely to run out of steam. Even holding steady involves an unsubstantiated leap of faith\u2014never fleshed out as to how it all could possibly work. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not\u201d is about the best one can expect.\n\nMined materials are likewise non-renewable and being consumed at an all-time-high rate. Ore grade has fallen dramatically, so that we now must pursue increasingly marginal and deeper deposits and thus impact more land, while discharging an ever-increasing volume of mine tailings. This happened fast: most material extraction has occurred in the last century (or even 50 years). We would be foolish to imagine an extrapolation of the past or even maintaining similar levels of activity for any long duration. More realistically, these practices will be undercut by declining population and energy availability. I\u2019ve spent plenty of time pointing out that recycling can at best stretch out the timeline, but not by orders of magnitude.\n\nWater/Agriculture\n\nAgricultural productivity has also steadily increased, but on the back of \u201cmining\u201d non-renewable resources like ground water and soils\u2014not to mention an extraordinary dependence on finite fossil fuels. Okay: at least water and soils can renew on long timescales, but our rate of depletion far outstrips replenishment. Land turned to desert by overuse stops even trying to maintain soils, while also suppressing water replenishment by squelching rainfall. This is yet another domain where the fact that the past has involved a steady march in one direction is quite far from guaranteeing that direction as a constant of nature. Its very \u201csuccess\u201d is what hastens its failure. The simple logic of \u201chasn\u2019t happened yet\u201d blithely bypasses a lot of context sitting in plain sight.\n\nClimate Change\n\nI don\u2019t usually stress climate change, because I view it as one symptom of a more general disease. Moreover, should we magically eliminate climate change in a blink, my assessment is hardly altered since so many other factors are contributing to the overall phenomenon of modernity\u2019s unsustainability. I include climate change here because it seems to be the one element that has percolated to the attention of the pundit-class as a potential existential threat. It isn\u2019t yet clear how modernity trucks on without fossil fuels. Yet, even if we were to curtail their use by 2050, the climate damage may be great enough to reverse modernity\u2019s fortunes (actually, the most catastrophic legacy of CO 2 emissions may be ocean acidification rather than climate change). Again, the \u201clogic\u201d of extrapolation becomes rather dubious. The faith-based assumption is that we will \u201ctechnology\u201d our way out of the crisis, which becomes perfectly straightforward if ignoring all the other factors at play. Increased materials demand to \u201ctechnofix\u201d our ills (and the associated mining, habitat destruction, pollution) puts a fly in the ointment. But most concerning to me is what we already do with energy. Answer: initiate a sixth mass extinction by running a resource-hungry, human supremacist, global market economy. Most climate change \u201csolutions\u201d assign top priority to maintaining the destructive juggernaut at full speed\u2014without question.\n\nEcological Collapse\n\nThis brings me to the ultimate peril. As large, hungry, high-maintenance mammals on this planet, we are utterly dependent on a healthy, vibrant, biodiverse ecology\u2014in ways we can\u2019t begin to fathom. It\u2019s beyond our meat-brain capacity to appreciate. Long-term survival at the hands of evolution has never once required cognitive comprehension of the myriad subtle relationships necessary for a stable community of life. An amoeba, mayfly, newt, or hedgehog gets on just fine without such knowledge. What is required is fitting into the niches and interrelationships patiently worked out through the process of evolution. Guess what: in a flash, we jumped the tracks into a patently non-ecological lifestyle not vetted by evolution to be viable. It appears to be not even close.\n\nThis is not just a theoretical concern. Biologists are pretty clear that a sixth mass extinction is underway as a direct result of modernity. The dots are not particularly hard to connect. We mine and spew/dispose materials alien to the community of life into the environment. Good luck, critters! We eliminate or shatter wild space in favor of \u201cdeveloped\u201d land: exterminating, eradicating, displacing, and impoverishing the life that depends on that land and its resident web of life. The struggle can take decades to resolve as populations ebb\u2014generation after generation\u2014on the road to inevitable failure. Even this decades-long process is effectively instant compared to the millions of years over which the intricate web was crafted.\n\nI have pointed out a number of times that we are now down to 2.5 kg of wild land mammal mass per human on the planet. It was 80 kg per person in 1800 and 50,000 kg per person before the start of the agricultural revolution\u2014when humans held a roughly proportionate share of mammal biomass compared to the other mammal species. In my lifetime (born 1970), the average decline in vertebrate populations has been roughly 70%. Fish, insects, birds decline at 1\u20132% per year, which compounds quickly. Extinction rates are now hundreds of times higher than the background, almost all of which has transpired in the last century.\n\nJust like the golf ball in the room or the rock tumbling down the mountainside, these figures allow us to place approximate, relevant timescales on the phenomenon of ecological collapse\u2014and that timescale is at the sub-century level. We\u2019re watching its opening act, and the rate is alarming. The consequences, however, are easily brushed aside in ignorance. Try it yourself: mention to someone that humans can\u2019t survive ecological collapse and\u2014Family Feud style\u2014I\u2019d put my money on \u201cI don\u2019t see why not\u201d being among the most frequent responses.\n\nSo, Don\u2019t Give Me That\u2026\n\nI think you can see why I\u2019m not swayed by the tidy and fully-decontextualized lazy logic of extrapolation offered by some of the smartest people. This psychologically satisfying logic can have such a powerfully persuasive pull that it short-circuits serious considerations of the counterarguments. This is especially true when the relevant subjects are uncomfortable, inconvenient, unfamiliar, and also happen to be beyond our capacity to cognitively master. Just because we can\u2019t understand something doesn\u2019t render it non-existent. Seeking answers from within our brains gets what it deserves: garbage in\u2014garbage out.\n\nWe used the metaphors of a golf ball or rolling stone necessarily coming to rest. Likewise, a thrown rock will return to the ground, or a flying contraption not based on the aerodynamic principles of sustainable flight will fail to stay aloft. Modernity has no ecological context (no rich set of evolved interrelationships and co-dependencies with the rest of the community of life) and is rapidly demonstrating its unsustainable nature on many parallel, interconnected fronts. This would seem to make the default position clear: modernity will come to rest on a century-ish timescale, the initial reversal possibly becoming evident in mere decades. [Correction: I think it will likely be mostly stopped on a century timescale, but it may take millennia to fully melt into whatever mode comes next.]\n\nRetreating to the logic of extrapolation or basic unpredictability amounts to a faith-based approach that deflects any actual analysis: a cowardly dodge. Given the multi-layer, parallel concerns all pointing to a temporary modernity, it would seem to put the burden of proof that \u201cthe unsustainable can be sustained\u201d squarely on the collapse-deniers. The default position is that unsustainable systems fail; that non-ecological modes lack longevity; that unprecedented and extreme departures do not become the rule; that no species is capable of going-it alone. Arguing the extraordinary obverse demands extraordinary evidence, which of course is not availing itself.\n\nWhen logic suggests an attractive bypass, recognize that logic is only a narrow and disconnected component of a more complete, complex reality. Most importantly, the logic of extrapolation only serves to throw up a cautionary flag, without even bothering to address the relevant dynamics. That particular flag is later recognized as a misfire once the appropriate elements are given due consideration: this time is different, because modernity is outrageously different from the larger temporal and ecological context. Pretending otherwise requires turning a spider\u2019s-worth of blind eyes to protect a short-term, ideological, emotionally \u201csafe\u201d agenda. Pretend all you want: it won\u2019t change what\u2019s real.\n\nTeaser image credit: Author supplied."

        "full_text": "Most of us associate Berkshire Hathaway with Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger, but in the early 1970s they were part of a trio that also included Rick Guerin.\n\nAll three possessed exceptional analytical skills and a deep understanding of value investing principles. Yet most people have only heard of the first two. Buffett once said when markets crashed nearly 70% in 1973-74, Guerin, who had borrowed heavily to invest in equity, faced devastating margin calls. This forced him to sell his Berkshire Hathaway shares to Buffett for less than $40 each. Those shares are worth about $740,000 today, making this one of history's most expensive lessons in patience.\n\nThe power of compounding\n\nThe mathematical magic of compounding represents perhaps the strongest argument in favour of patience in investing. Compound interest is the \"eighth wonder of the world\", according to a quote popularly (but perhaps incorrectly) attributed to Albert Einstein. Even if the attribution is incorrect, though, the point stands.\n\nCompound interest is what allows investments to grow exponentially, but its true magic only materialises over long periods of time. An investment that's growing at an average annual return of 8% will double approximately every nine years, but over two decades or more, the same investment could multiply several times over. This exponential growth explains why investors who remain patient often achieve dramatically better results than those who frequently enter and exit positions.\n\nAlso read | Unlocking global markets: How to diversify with portfolio management services\n\nThe snowball effect of compounding is silent but powerful, transforming modest investments into substantial wealth over time. For instance, \u20b910,000 invested with an average annual return of 7% would grow to about \u20b920,000 in 10 years. But if allowed to compound for 30 years, it would balloon to \u20b976,000. This shows why patience isn't merely a virtue in investing \u2014 it's essential to building wealth.\n\nLeverage is a double-edged sword\n\nFinancial markets naturally fluctuate owing to economic events, geopolitical developments, and changes in investor sentiment. Without patience, these natural market rhythms can trigger emotional decision-making, including panic selling during downturns or chasing overpriced assets during bull runs. Adding leverage to to mix when investing in volatile assets can increase your returns when the bet works in your favour, but will wipe you out quickly if it doesn't.\n\nBenjamin Graham said it best: \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine\". By being patient and resisting the urge to invest using leverage, you can avoid costly mistakes that compound negatively over time. Those who use leverage don\u2019t have an option but to sell at loss during downturns, so it's best avoided.\n\nPsychological discipline of successful investing\n\nSuccess in investing depends as much on discipline as on analytical skill. Patience is the cornerstone of emotional discipline and crucial for achieving exceptional long-term results. Fear and greed represent powerful forces that can derail even the most sophisticated investment strategy. Patient investors develop the capacity to resist these emotional triggers, making decisions based on fundamental value rather than market sentiment.\n\nThis psychological discipline manifests in several ways. Patient investors avoid checking their portfolios obsessively as they understand that daily fluctuations have little bearing on long-term performance. They stick to their investment strategy rather than chasing the latest fad.

By consistently contributing to a well-diversified portfolio, investors can work toward meeting their long-term objectives, whether retirement, buying a home, or funding a child's education.\n\nLong-term investing also offers significant tax advantages, as holding investments for more than a year results in lower capital-gains tax.

        "full_text": "Switching from gas to electric? Here are 3 appliances that are easy to install\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Retired pediatrician Max Van Gilder, 79, loves to cook and calls himself an \"early adopter\" of new technology. That's put him on the leading edge of a new segment of the appliance industry focused on climate-conscious consumers.\n\nVan Gilder replaced a gas stove in his Manhattan apartment last year with an electric Copper induction stove. \"Its serial number is 72,\" Van Gilder says as he fries pork and boils water for spaghetti carbonara.\n\nInduction stoves typically need special wiring or a larger plug, adding hundreds of dollars in electrical work to the cost of the appliance itself. But Van Gilder's stove plugs into a conventional outlet. A battery under the oven charges through the night and powers the stove when he cooks.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nChanging from gas to more climate-friendly electric appliances often involves expensive retrofits, such as hiring an electrician or contractor and sometimes upgrading electricity service from the utility. But a growing list of companies have begun to offer appliances that make switching easier and cheaper, with designs that allow customers to plug them into a standard outlet.\n\n\"What you're seeing is the desire of consumers to start to move to all electric appliances and then manufacturers responding with products to overcome one of the key barriers to that,\" says Panama Bartholomy, executive director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition.\n\nThree products dominate this emerging market segment now \u2014 battery induction stoves, window heat pumps and plug-in heat pump water heaters. And manufacturers have plans to offer more appliances.\n\nBattery induction stove\n\nNearly one-third of the greenhouse gases heating the planet come from buildings \u2014 much of it from burning natural gas in appliances. That's why one key climate solution is electrification \u2014 switching from climate-warming methane, the main ingredient in natural gas, to electric appliances and heaters powered by an increasingly cleaner grid.\n\nGas stoves have been of particular interest to climate advocates, who want to electrify buildings, and the gas utility industry, which has used tobacco industry tactics to avoid regulation.\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR\n\nVan Gilder wanted to get rid of his gas stove for both climate and safety reasons. \"As I'm getting older, I was afraid that I would leave the gas on,\" he says. And he wanted an induction stove because it's more efficient, complies with New York's plan to eliminate fossil fuels from large buildings and he likes the control they offer a cook. Induction stoves heat pans with magnetism rather than flames or an electric coil.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The only thing about an induction stove is it needs 220 volts of electricity,\" Van Gilder says. He asked his co-op apartment board if it was possible to install the wires needed, but it was too expensive. A friend told him about the Copper stove with a battery that plugs into a regular outlet.\n\nAfter using it for a few months, Van Gilder says he likes the stove and has discovered a few extra benefits.\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR\n\n\"The kitchen doesn't heat up like it used to,\" he says. Because the stove heats the pot directly, it doesn't send heat into the room like a gas or traditional electric stove. He says the smooth cooktop is easier to clean too. The Copper stoves do have a hefty price tag, though.\n\n\"The base price is $6,000. There's a tax credit that brings it down to about $4,000,\" says Sam Calisch, Copper founder and CEO. He says that can still be a bargain for older, multifamily buildings with gas pipes that sometimes leak climate-warming methane and need to be fixed or replaced.\n\n\"In these cases, we install for less than half of what it costs just to fix the gas system and then we allow that building to retire that old, aging infrastructure and decarbonize,\" Calisch says.\n\nWindow heat pump\n\nHeat pumps have become popular with consumers, even inspiring a sultry R&B song. They provide heating and cooling with less energy than traditional furnaces and air conditioners. But heat pumps usually require expensive modifications to a home by contractors, plumbers and electricians.\n\nNow, manufacturers are making heat pumps that plug into a standard outlet and can be installed in a window. Joe Soto, 69, is testing one in his Woodside, N.Y., apartment.\n\n\"I call ourselves the guinea pigs,\" Soto says, chuckling. He says he's happy to be a part of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) test because he and his wife are comfortable year-round now. NYCHA used to heat Soto's home with steam radiators. \"It wasn't very reliable. There were times that we spent many winters freezing in the cold,\" he says.\n\ntoggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR\n\nNow his two-bedroom apartment has three window heat pumps mounted in windows like a portable air conditioner, but they take up less window space.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"The beauty of this is it's also a cooling system,\" Soto says. \"The temperature has been constant \u2014 winter, [or] the summer you don't feel the difference.\"\n\nSoto's window heat pumps were made by the company Midea. Another manufacturer is Gradient, which says its $3,800 appliance is designed to be easy to install. Most of the company's customers are building owners, who can save money by avoiding expensive retrofits.\n\n\"We can install our system without any building modification, without any electricians, without holes in the wall, without asbestos mitigation, without scaffolding,\" says Vince Romanin, Gradient's founder and chief technology officer. \"It is a 30-minute install.\"\n\nEventually, Romanin says he'd like to sell the company's window heat pumps directly to tenants.\n\nPlug-in heat pump water heater\n\nHeat pump technology is showing up in water heaters, too, including some that plug into a regular outlet and are designed to replace gas water heaters.\n\n\"We knew we wanted to go green as much as possible and cut the gas cord if we could,\" says Laura Nakamura, who replaced her gas water heater with a plug-in heat pump water heater last year in the garage of her Concord, Calif., home.\n\n\"It was all done in one day. It wasn't a major overhaul,\" and she says the new model works as well as the old gas one. \"It's just as hot. And the water is still just as wet.\"\n\nShe has noticed the new water heater is louder. She measured it at 60 decibels on a smartphone application \u2014 nearly as loud as her clothes dryer. That's not a problem for her, since the water heater is in her garage. And Nakamura noticed a benefit \u2014 because a heat pump takes heat from the garage to warm water, it leaves the garage cooler, something she looks forward to in the summer.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nPlug-in heat pump water heaters also take longer to recover, once you've used the water in the tank.\n\n\"Because of the slower recovery, we do often recommend that those are installed in warmer states,\" says James Courtney, director of product management at water heater manufacturer Rheem. \" Really, the main thing is the incoming ground water temperature.\"\n\nWarmer water coming into a house requires less energy to make it hot. Courtney suggests talking with a plumber or contractor because there are ways to mitigate the slower recovery time.\n\n\"A solution might be that you just upsize your tank if you have the space,\" he says. If your old gas water heater held 50 gallons of 120 degrees Fahrenheit water, you could get a 65 or 80 gallon version of the new climate-friendly model and heat the water to 140 degrees.\n\n\"We have a built-in mixing valve attached to the water heater,\" Courtney says, and the water heater will \"then mix that hot water with the incoming cold water down to the 120 degrees.\" That mimics what the old gas water heater used to provide.\n\nThese new water heaters cost about $2,000 more than a comparable gas one. But government incentives can reduce some of the extra cost. Nakamura navigated that sometimes-confusing process through the company Quit Carbon, which also helped her find a plumber.\n\n\"In addition to not using plastic bags at the grocery store, it's one of those things that if people have the means and it's time to upgrade to a water heater, this is something that I think people should be looking into,\" Nakamura says. She's the vice mayor in Concord and also has been active with a local clean energy group.\n\nCourtney says plug-in heat pump water heaters are still a small portion of the water heater market, but he says they're the fastest growing. And manufacturers are working on more products that are designed to easily replace gas appliances.\n\nSponsor Message\n\n\"I know there are manufacturers looking [at] putting batteries inside heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems,\" says Bartholomy. That would make it possible to plug an HVAC system into a regular outlet and continue to operate when the power goes out.\n\n"

        "full_text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough week for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is facing a revolt from his party\u2019s faithful as a result of his decision to vote, along with nine other Democrats, to pass last week\u2019s continuing resolution and keep the government open.\n\nThe fallout was as immediate as it was furious, with calls erupting for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., darling of the far-left to primary Schumer in his next reelection bid, and angry recriminations of surrender filling Washington DC.\n\nAs far as a primary goes, Schumer won\u2019t show up on the ballot for another three years, which is the current chronology of American politics might as well be three decades, so let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nSCHUMER PRESSED ON WHETHER HE SHOULD STEP DOWN AMID SPENDING BILL FALLOUT DURING 'THE VIEW'\n\nBut what if, even though Democrats are loath to admit it, Schumer\u2019s do-nothing approach to Trump\u2019s second and wildly more aggressive administration not only makes sense, but is the most effective way to fight Trump, at least in the short term.\n\nIn the first frenetic 35 days of Trump\u2019s presidency, this time around, it was the Democrats who just couldn\u2019t be normal in their response, culminating in the circus performance of walkouts, matching outfits and refusal to cheer for a childhood cancer survivor at the commander-in-chief's joint address to Congress.\n\nOver the past two weeks, however, it is Trump who is veering, if not into abnormality, at least into unconventional actions that Americans haven\u2019t seen before. These include tariffs on our allies, record breaking deportations, and a realignment of our foreign policy in regard to Russia.\n\nWhat Schumer understands, even as liberals like \"The Daily Show\u2019s\" Jon Stewart insist he \"do something!\" is that there is nothing Congressional Republicans can do right now to stop Trump, including shutting down the government.\n\nREPUBLICANS EVISCERATE SCHUMER FOR 'MOCKING HARDWORKING AMERICANS' ON 'THE VIEW': 'SERIOUSLY CHUCK?'\n\nSo what is Chuck\u2019s plan? He laid it out quite clearly last week, stressing the need for Democrats to push Trump\u2019s job approval lower, he said, \"He was at 51, he\u2019s now at 48, we\u2019re going to keep at it until he is under 40.\"\n\nWhat Schumer, and his more moderate allies, no doubt recognize is that going into this week, Donald Trump was underwater in the Real Clear Politics Average of approval polls for the first time since being re-elected.\n\nsch\n\nWhy on earth would the Democrats have wanted to toss Trump a lifeline by shutting down the government?\n\nSCHUMER SAYS 'OLIGARCHS' KEEP HIM UP AT NIGHT, DESPITE HIS OWN TIES TO BILLIONAIRES\n\nIf Democrats sincerely believe that Trump\u2019s policies will lead to disaster, that tariffs will raise prices, that Americans will be repelled by mass deportations, and that treating with Vladimir Putin will have nightmarish geopolitical consequences, then why get in the way, especially when you have no leverage anyway?\n\nAnd Schumer is not alone in his more reserved approach to challenging Trump, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., who has begged his party not to set its hair on fire every time Trump opens his mouth, also voted to keep the government funded.\n\nMeanwhile, California governor and presumptive White House hopeful Gavin Newsom is inviting MAGA figures like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk on his podcast, while former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is running for mayor of Gotham while barely mentioning Trump\u2019s name.\n\nEven the Ragin Cajun, longtime Democratic strategist James Carville has called for calm, writing in these pages recently, \"I think it\u2019s evident to anyone and everyone that Democrats' response needs to be deliberate, determined and dignified\u2014not \"The Charge of the Light Brigade. I understand that Democrats are anxious and demanding more, but there\u2019s a thing called a calendar, and there are opportunities abound.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThis wing of the party, which is still too progressive for the country on key issues, at least understands the virtue of political patience, which is exactly why far-left Democrats are eager to crush this \"normal\" form of opposition.\n\nAOC, The Squad and Nancy Pelosi are in no mood to give the Party of Jefferson & Jackson over to a bunch of moderate white guys.\n\nMake no mistake, Trump\u2019s first month in office was a glorious dash of campaign promises kept, but it was also focused on many 70/30 or even 80/20 issues, such as men in women\u2019s sports, or closing the southern border.\n\nNow, the Trump administration must pivot to 50/50 issues, a much heavier political lift.\n\nA new Gallup poll shows a 16 percent increase in support for Ukraine among Americans since December, deportations are moving beyond hardened criminals, and some Americans are nervous that Trump\u2019s grand economic long-term plan might come with short-term pain.\n\nChuck Schumer didn\u2019t rise from the streets of Brooklyn to become the most powerful Democrat in Washington by being an idiot. He and Fetterman, and a host of smart Democrats are forgoing the constant anti-Trump caterwaul and biding their time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs Republicans seek to grow their majority in 2026 and solidify power in 2028, the biggest challenge they will face is not angry leftists chanting in the streets, it is calm, composed Democrats lying in wait for any and all mistakes that Trump might make.\n\nAnd that is exactly Chuck Schumer\u2019s plan.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS\n\n"

        "full_text": "Episode Transcript\n\nThis is a computer-generated transcript. While our team has reviewed it, there may be errors.\n\nMorgan Sung: This is The Purge\u2026 Of government websites. Since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, federal agency and military websites have been wiped. Some are gone completely, while others have been overhauled to remove any references to so-called woke terminology, all in this effort to comply with an executive order to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the federal government.\n\nAnd it seems like in the rush to remove all of these woke words, there were maybe some unintentional cuts, like when the Department of Defense took down a 1940s photo. It was a picture of a pilot, posing in front of one of the planes that dropped the atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But what does this photo have to do with diversity, equity, or inclusion? Well, the plane was named the Enola Gay. It was named after the pilot\u2019s mother, Enola Gay Tibbitts. There are still other photos of the Enola Gay available on government websites, but in the past few months, countless pages with crucial information have been wiped from the internet.\n\nFortunately, for journalists, historians, and anyone who cares about keeping track of facts, there\u2019s a tool that lets us go back and see exactly how those websites have changed. Unfortunately, that very tool is under threat.\n\nThis is Close All Tabs. I\u2019m Morgan Sung, tech journalist and your chronically online friend, here to open as many browser tabs as it takes to help you understand how the digital world affects our real lives. Let\u2019s get into it.\n\nClose All Tabs Senior Editor Chris Egusa is gonna walk us through this magical tool called the Wayback Machine.\n\nChris Egusa: Hey, Morgan.\n\nMorgan Sung: So I already have a tab open. It\u2019s the current version of the State Department\u2019s safety tips for queer people traveling abroad. And you have your own tab.\n\nChris Egusa: So it\u2019s the same web page, same URL, but I have gone back in time, kind of. That\u2019s where the Wayback Machine comes in. It\u2019s part of this organization called the Internet Archive. And for the past 30 years, it\u2019s basically scraped the internet page by page and archived it. So if you have a URL or link to a website, you can go back and see all the ways that that website has changed. I used the Wayback Machine to look at the page from January 5th, before this executive order. At the top of the page, it\u2019s addressed to LGBTQI plus travelers.\n\nMorgan Sung: Unlike the one I\u2019m seeing, the one that\u2019s currently live, which just says, L-G-B Travelers. What else does your version have?\n\nChris Egusa: So it has a lot of resources. It has instructions for changing your passport\u2019s gender marker, warnings about conversion therapy practices in other countries, and also links to the National Center for Transgender Equality and other organizations.\n\nMorgan Sung: Yeah, this current one I have on my screen doesn\u2019t have any of that, just no warnings about conversion therapy and definitely none of those resources for trans people. There\u2019s actually no mention of trans people at all. They kept a link to the Trevor Project, but they made a point to say that it\u2019s an organization for LGB youth.\n\nChris Egusa: Which is wild, because the Trevor Project is very involved in advocating for trans youth and gender-affirming care.\n\nMorgan Sung: Yeah, and again, this is just one page out of who knows how many that have been altered to take the T out of LGBT. How panicked should we be about the scale of erasure of public information?\n\nChris Egusa: Well, this has happened before. During Trump\u2019s first term, pages about climate change and the environment were altered to soften the language, or they were just wiped entirely.\n\nMorgan Sung: But that purge wasn\u2019t nearly as expansive or haphazard as the one we\u2019re currently living through, right?\n\nChris Egusa: No, but I think it has prepared a lot of us for a situation like this. This time around, a lot more people are relying on the Wayback Machine and the Internet Archive.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, and in all of this mess, the existence of the internet archive itself is under threat, which could spell trouble for the future of all online libraries. So to get a better understanding of it all, Chris, you went to the archive in person a few weeks ago. Let\u2019s start there. Let\u2019s make that our first tab. What is the Internet Archive? You know, when I think of the Internet Archive, I\u2019m thinking of like the Matrix, Cyberchase, when they\u2019re like running through this kind of like cloud and there are just binary numbers everywhere. But the Internet Archive is a real physical location.\n\nChris Egusa: Yeah, no, it\u2019s a real place. It is not in the Matrix. It is in San Francisco in the Richmond district. It\u2019s in this very grand building and out front it has these huge Greek columns that kind of line the entrance of it. They actually chose the building in part because it resembles the archive\u2019s logo, which is the columns of the Library of Alexandria.\n\nMorgan Sung: The Library of Alexandria. I mean, that is like the Greek idea of a universal library. That\u2019s a pretty lofty idea to aspire to.\n\nChris Egusa: It is. And the organization isn\u2019t shy about their ambitions. Their stated mission is to provide, quote, universal access to all knowledge. According to their website, the archive currently contains, and I\u2019m just gonna reel off a bunch of numbers here, 835 billion webpages. I think last I checked, that number\u2019s actually close to a trillion. 44 million books and texts, 15 million audio recordings, 10.6 million videos, and on and on.\n\nMorgan Sung: Wow.\n\nChris Egusa: It\u2019s a lot, like, I can\u2019t even quite conceptualize what a trillion web pages even looks like.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, Chris, tell me, what was the archive actually like?\n\nChris Egusa: It was actually really cool. Brewster Kahle is the founder of the archive and he was really excited to give me a tour and introduce me to all kinds of old media devices they\u2019d collected over the years.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Edison invented these cylinders in 1880. Mostly, you know, things that you\u2019ve never heard.\n\nChris Egusa: So yeah, right when we got there, we go up some stairs and he shows me this very vintage, beautiful old gramophone.\n\nBrewster Kahle: It\u2019s a Victor Talking Machine 5 from 1927. So it\u2019s a old 78 RPM player, no electricity, it\u2019s a crank, has a horn, so spinning up.\n\nSong: Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey / A kiddley divey too, wouldn\u2019t you?\n\nChris Egusa: I don\u2019t know if you recognize that song, but it immediately made me think of Twin Peaks.\n\nMorgan Sung: Yes! Yes, it does. I am right in the middle of my rewatch right now, so\u2026\n\nChris Egusa: I need to do a re-watch in David Lynch\u2019s honor, for sure. Yeah, and then when he started playing this, he then started dancing around the room, which is just like-.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, Audrey Horne.\n\nChris Egusa: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSong: A little bit jumbled and jivey\n\nChris Egusa: So after visiting this little museum area, Brewster takes me into this huge room and it has this beautiful domed ceiling. It used to be a Christian Science Church. The whole building did. There are all these lines of pews that are facing where the pulpit used to be. And in place of that pulpit, there\u2019s this huge projector screen. And so they use this place for like movie screenings, for local community events and things. But there is one thing that draws your eye more than anything else in the room. That is the statues.\n\nMorgan Sung: Statues?\n\nChris Egusa: Yeah, they are these hundreds of terracotta figures. They are about waist high, and each one of them has distinct features in clothing. And they\u2019re all kind of facing forward, like they\u2019re congregants in this hall of worship. Haunting. So it\u2019s a bit of an eerie scene, but according to Brewster\u2026\n\nBrewster Kahle: If you work for the archive for three years, then we make a little statue. Basically tributes to the people that made the organization happen.\n\nMorgan Sung: So not like framed photos, just a three foot statue.\n\nChris Egusa: Yes, exactly. And they\u2019re really detailed. Another employee was with us on the tour. His name is Chris Freeland.\n\nChris Freeland: It\u2019s weird to be standing here in front of a terracotta statue of yourself, but here we are. It does look like me, and that\u2019s also uncanny. Everyone says they got the beard right, which is making me sad, since it is covered in gray and no longer brown, or red-brown, like it was when I was, you know, 20 years younger, but here we are.\n\nChris Egusa: And all these statues are standing in the pews and around the outside of the room, facing the front, sort of at attention.\n\nMorgan Sung: You know what this reminds me of? It\u2019s that terracotta army that\u2019s like protecting the tomb of like the first emperor of China. And they\u2019re meant to like protect the emperor in the afterlife. And I guess it\u2019s fitting because these statues look like they\u2019re, I don\u2019t know, protecting the internet ephemera long after it\u2019s gone.\n\nChris Egusa: That\u2019s actually very appropriate because behind all of these statues in the very back of the room is where the servers live. Um, he tells me that they hold 145 petabytes of data, which I don\u2019t deal in petabytes, it\u2019s the one after terabyte. Um, so it\u2019s a lot. And yeah, these are the servers where all of the billions of web pages, videos, and audio, where all of it lives. There\u2019s a cool moment actually, like when you stare at these devices, you see all of these twinkling blue lights flashing and flickering across them, um, like hundreds a second. And here is what Brewster told me about that.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Every time a light blinks is somebody uploading or downloading something from the Internet Archive. I think that the technology reflects the people that make it, so let\u2019s make it beautiful.\n\nMorgan Sung: That sounds almost magical. I mean, I get how this could be like a religious experience.\n\nChris Egusa: Yes, and I almost compare it to the way that old cathedrals were meant to evoke that sense of awe. It was hard not to feel a little awestruck being in that place.\n\nBrewster Kahle: These servers hold some non-trivial percentage of all of the published works of humankind.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, so tell me about Brewster, the guy who founded this whole thing, started this statue army and this cathedral of servers.\n\nChris Egusa: So, as you can already tell, Brewster is pretty eccentric and he kind of comes from that old school vision of the internet where he thinks it should be free and open. He really feels that now power is way too concentrated in a few big companies.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Companies often don\u2019t sell anything anymore. They just license it. Now, if you use Netflix or Spotify, you don\u2019t even have a video library like you used to with DVDs or you don\u2019t have MP3s on your device or records in your collections. So there\u2019s been this shift by the large-scale publishers towards ongoing control of materials and surveillance of what it is being viewed.\n\nChris Egusa: They believe that most things should be open and available to the public, and especially that old things should be preserved, even old webpages. And so that\u2019s where you get the Wayback Machine.\n\nBrewster Kahle: We have the World Wide Web on Archive.org, available back to 1996, so you can go and find your old webpages, your old GeoCity sites, or whatever it is that you\u2019ve done in the past. But it also is relevant to people currently. Journalists are using it a lot to find, well, what did that person say? And they\u2019re saying something kind of different. um\u2026 and they said they never said that well no we don\u2019t know we found that in the television news archive and you can search and find this on television transcripts uh\u2026 back to 2009.\n\nChris Egusa: And you can tell that Brewster is old school because he uses the phrase worldwide web, which I love.\n\nMorgan Sung: So vintage of him.\n\nChris Egusa: Yeah, it is kind of miraculous. I do feel that you can go back and look at a website like that and see exactly what it looked like, but there\u2019s no other place that that exists.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, so clearly the Internet Archive is this incredible resource. Is it true that it might shut down?\n\nChris Egusa: Well, let\u2019s talk about it.\n\nMorgan Sung: Yeah, let\u2019s open a new tab on that, but right after this break. Okay, new tab, Internet Archive Lawsuits. So let\u2019s talk about these lawsuits that the Internet Archive is facing. They\u2019re not about the Wayback Machine or the webpage archiving, right? They\u2019re about a totally different part of the archive\u2019s operations.\n\nChris Egusa: So the Internet Archive also has these huge operations where they preserve old physical media. In some cases, the stuff they\u2019re preserving is very clearly public material that is for public access. Like they have this program called Democracy\u2019s Library, where they go and digitize all the print records for all kinds of government agencies. But they also digitize things like books and music, and sometimes that includes copyrighted material. So there are two specific lawsuits at the center of this. The first was a case called Hachette v. Internet Archive, and that was brought against the Internet Archive by book publishers. They objected to the Archive\u2019s practice of digitizing books and lending them out digitally, even though many of them were out of print.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, but that sounds like a normal library thing.\n\nChris Egusa: Yeah, it kind of is, though there is a wrinkle to it because of this program they did in 2020 during the pandemic lockdowns. So before, the archive operated kind of how libraries normally do. They have a certain number of licenses, you can check each book out, but during this time it became unlimited access for anyone. Though I will say that Brewster and his team strongly dispute the idea that the case was about this pandemic era program at all. They say the lawsuit had been planned before that program ever started.\n\nEither way, after a lengthy appeals process, the judge did rule against them, and the judgment required the Internet Archive to pay publishers an undisclosed amount. And even though the lawsuit was about like these specific 127 copyrighted works, the Archive ended up removing over 500,000 books from their digital collection, which free speech and pro-access people were very upset about because a lot of these books aren\u2019t available anywhere else.\n\nMorgan Sung: And that brings us to this next lawsuit. This was brought on by the music industry, two major record labels, Universal Music Group and Sony Music. What can you tell us about this case?\n\nChris Egusa: So this suit was brought against them in 2023 and it centers around another one of the Internet Archive\u2019s programs. This one is called the Great 78 Project. And 78 stands for 78 RPM records. It\u2019s a format that was super popular from the 1890s to like the late 1950s. And this program was this massive communal undertaking to digitize and preserve these very old 78s. They digitized and cataloged more than 400,000 of these recordings since starting the project in 2017. And they made those recordings available to the public to stream on their website. And the key here is how they thought about this project. They felt like they were undertaking the preservation of a defunct technology and the sound of American culture in a bygone era.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Those older materials that were sort of foundational of what did America sound like are so obsolete that we went and we circulated in the industry conferences to say, \u201cokay, there\u2019s going to be this project, the Great 78 Project,\u201d and libraries and archives, a hundred different ones came together to go inform this. The industry knew about it. They were all supportive that when we talked to them, it was all great.\n\nMorgan Sung: But the record labels saw things differently.\n\nChris Egusa: They definitely did. In their lawsuit, the labels called the Great 78 Project quote, \u201cwholesale theft of generations of music.\u201d And they claim that by making the records available to stream for free, that the Internet Archive was displacing streams that generate royalties on platforms like Spotify or Apple Music, royalties that could have gone to either the platforms themselves or the copyright holders like the artists.\n\nMorgan Sung: Well, do they have a point?\n\nChris Egusa: So obviously I\u2019m not a legal expert, but here\u2019s what the record labels say. In the suit, they\u2019re focusing on 4,000 specific recordings that do have copyright protections. They are commercially available and many of them are still very popular, including Bing Crosby\u2019s White Christmas, which is the best-selling single of all time. So I think it\u2019s gonna be tough.\n\nMorgan Sung: And we know what the actual amount that they\u2019re suing for is, right?\n\nChris Egusa: So it\u2019s $621 million. And just to put it in perspective, the Internet Archive\u2019s operating budget is a tiny fraction of that, just around $30 million.\n\nBrewster Kahle: If we\u2019re found guilty of being a library and then that will cost us, yes, it would snuff the Internet Archive. And that may be the point.\n\nMorgan Sung: That\u2019s pretty bleak.\n\nChris Egusa: Yeah it is. I will also add that regardless of where you land on, okay, was this copyright infringement or not, the details of the case strike me as kind of strange. First thing is there were a notably small number of streams per audio file in question. Um, like hundreds, or, you know, in some cases a few thousand. But not like hundreds of thousands or millions. And so, if you actually convert the number of streams to a dollar amount based on how much Spotify royalties pay, you\u2019re generally looking at a couple of dollars per audio file. A bit more in a few cases.\n\nSo clearly publishers are not experiencing, you know, dramatic monetary loss due to these relatively small number of streams. Right? But the record companies, they still decided to sue for the maximum amount under the law, which is $150,000 per record, even though they could have sued for less. They also never even asked the Internet Archive to take the records down. They never received a request. They were just slapped with this lawsuit.\n\nBrewster Kahle: And if we had gotten that list, we would have taken it down. And we did, once they sued it, you just give us the list and we would have taken them down.\n\nChris Egusa: But the other thing is, and I\u2019m not saying that this argument will hold up in court, but like, I think about a platform like YouTube, right? YouTube gets copyrighted material uploaded to it constantly. And the way it works is that when an interested copyright holding party requests that they remove certain content, that content then gets taken down.\n\nBrewster Kahle: I mean, that\u2019s the way the internet basically works and those 78s are on YouTube. So it\u2019s, so we basically have a, they\u2019re after something else.\n\nChris Egusa: He thinks the publishing companies are going after the library system itself, the ability for people to access materials for free.\n\nBrewster Kahle: The bigger picture that\u2019s going on and the real contest is not about money, it\u2019s actually about control. Can libraries own anything in the digital world? Is there digital ownership? That\u2019s the central characteristic. And there\u2019s a question, \u201cis the United States going to have libraries have their traditional roles of buying, preserving, lending and interlibrary loan?\u201d\n\nChris Egusa: But the case itself likely won\u2019t move forward until later this year, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that develops.\n\nMorgan Sung: All right, changing gears a little bit. We are a tech show, so I feel like we\u2019re almost contractually obligated to mention AI somehow in almost every episode that we make. But I don\u2019t know, Chris, that feels like a new tab.\n\nChris Egusa: I think so.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, new tab, Internet Archive and AI Legal Battles. AI companies have also been hit by big lawsuits from publishers, and you may not think of it at first, but AI companies like ChatGPT and the Internet Archive have some similarities. They both use tools to scrape the web for data and text and other content. Of course, what they do is different. The Internet Archive stores and preserves it, while AI companies use it to train their models. What\u2019s Brewster\u2019s take on AI?\n\nChris Egusa: So he\u2019s a big proponent actually.\n\nBrewster Kahle: We\u2019re using the AI technologies for a bunch of what may seem like mundane tasks, but are super helpful. Like putting metadata on all these government documents.\n\nChris Egusa: He says that one of the big problems with a site like the Internet Archive is that there\u2019s just so much stuff on there. Organization can be a struggle and people visiting the site can get overwhelmed. AI can make all of that easier by tagging and categorizing the billions of pieces of media they have to make them more easily findable.\n\nBrewster Kahle: I mean, if you go to archive.org anecdotally people say, \u201cYou know you kind of arrive and it\u2019s just huge and it\u2019s a mass and holy crow and I don\u2019t know where to start!\u201d And so if we could make that on ramp easier wouldn\u2019t that be fantastic.\n\nChris Egusa: And as far as the lawsuits against AI companies, he thinks that the laws are too in favor of publishers and copyright holders and that they should be relaxed to allow AI companies to operate more easily.\n\nBrewster Kahle: We don\u2019t have regulatory clarity. So there are now 80 lawsuits around the AI world. So it\u2019s going to be just who has more lawyers. And that\u2019s going to end up with just a few gigantic players.\n\nMorgan Sung: I mean, I\u2019m actually so surprised that he\u2019s pro-AI. We\u2019ve talked a lot about how AI has ushered in this era where everything is essentially editable. So yeah, for somebody who\u2019s so preoccupied with the preservation and accurate recording of history, I was surprised that he\u2019d be so on board with technology that seems to be like the antithesis of that in some ways.\n\nChris Egusa: Yeah. One thing that is clear is that the outcomes of these AI lawsuits could impact the Internet Archive because they\u2019re both about the enforcement of copyright law.\n\nMorgan Sung: Right, it seems like there\u2019s this trade-off where if you want a free and accessible internet where information is free and accessible, you also have to expect it to be scrapable.\n\nChris Egusa: 100%. And the Internet Archive does similar kinds of scraping techniques that AI companies do, like you said. Overall, it seems that he thinks that\u2019s a trade-off worth making.\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, so we have the Internet Archive, this organization that provides all these public services that the internet has become dependent on. And we also have this massive lawsuit that threatens to shut the organization down. I mean, it feels like we\u2019re in a moment where that possibility is more concerning than ever. We have political turbulence, disinformation, these new AI technologies that are making it harder and harder to get the truth.\n\nChris Egusa: Wait Morgan, Morgan\u2026\n\nMorgan Sung: Yeah?\n\nChris Egusa: Do you think that\u2019s a new tab?\n\nMorgan Sung: Okay, you know what? You\u2019re so right, Chris. Do you wanna do the honors?\n\nChris Egusa: I would love to. Let\u2019s open a new tab. What happens if the Internet Archive goes away?\n\nMorgan Sung: We talked about this at the top of the episode, but the Internet Archive plays such a critical role in our information ecosystem. And like Brewster says, our ability to go back and check the record. I mean, that\u2019s what we lose when we lose the Internet Archive.\n\nChris Egusa: It\u2019s such an important issue, especially right now. Brewster says that after each presidential term, they go through and catalog all of the government websites, including the ones we talked about earlier.\n\nBrewster Kahle: We have, since the year 2004, gone and done an end of term crawl to go and record all the federal websites that we possibly can to go and download and preserve what it looked like before the change and then right away after the change. And are there changes? Yes. Are there always changes? Yes. Are there changes that you agree with? Depends on how you voted, but the idea of library is we\u2019re there to preserve the record.\n\nMorgan Sung: I think the logical question is, what if it does shut down? What then? Has Brewster even entertained this idea?\n\nChris Egusa: I think it\u2019s hard for him to go there. Like, this is his life\u2019s work. But he has definitely thought about the threat that looms if our ability to preserve our understanding of the past goes away. So he references George Orwell\u2019s dystopian vision of the future from the book 1984.\n\nBrewster Kahle: The image of the memory hole is just the idea that next to your desk is this hole that you can go and put the only copy of that newspaper in an incinerator and be able to change history is upon us. The average life of a web page is 100 days before it\u2019s changed or deleted. If we do not actively collect them and preserve them and keep them accessible, we\u2019re living in the memory whole universe of George Orwell.\n\nMorgan Sung: Well, okay, is there any hope here? Is there only option to just give it and crawl into a memory hole and accept it?\n\nChris Egusa: I don\u2019t think we have to accept the memory hole, and I certainly hope that we don\u2019t. But I\u2019ll wrap up with an observation about Brewster himself. So what struck me about him the most was he just has this unrelenting optimism. He seems to truly love what he does, and he believes in it so strongly, and he\u2019s cultivated this team around him that really shares in that vision. So, even with the looming threat of this extinction-level lawsuit coming up from the music publishers, it\u2019s like he can\u2019t quite bring himself to imagine that the Internet Archive could really go away.\n\nBrewster Kahle: Oh, I think we\u2019re doing fine. I think that there might be pieces of the Internet Archive that are chiseled away by very powerful interests, but the idea of a library or even just the Internet Archive as an organization has got lots of support. So, can the Internet Archive go away? Yes. Would it be a bad thing, I would think so. But I think the real issues are going to be whether the legislatures and the judiciary go and side with people\u2019s access to information in some way or another. We\u2019ll see that play out over the next 25 years of the Internet Archive\u2019s life.\n\nChris Egusa: For Brewster, it\u2019s about the Internet Archive, of course, but it\u2019s also so much more.\n\nBrewster Kahle: I don\u2019t know the words exactly, but in every librarian\u2019s mind, those who control the past control the present, those who control the present control the future. The idea of a library is part of an ecosystem of how society remembers. That\u2019s how it thinks of itself. If you were to erase the Internet Archive and the libraries, which is in many ways happening now, then we will live in a danger of having people be able to recast what happened. Oh, as a society that believes in universal education and the fulfillment of individual possibility, we just can\u2019t let that happen.\n\nMorgan Sung: So are you ready to close these tabs?\n\nChris Egusa: Let\u2019s close these tabs.\n\nMorgan Sung: Close All Tabs is a production of KQED Studios and is reported and hosted by me, Morgan Sung.

        "url": "https://www.prdaily.com/crisis-playbooks-need-to-die/",
        "full_text": "By Maria Stagliano and Ian Christopher McCaleb, Blue Highway Advisory\n\nJust about anyone who has worked at a major corporation or public relations firm has come across the always pitched, often sold, rarely used \u2014 and typically ignored \u2014 magic fix-all \u201dBible\u201d of the PR industry: the crisis communications playbook. This sales asset is pushed to every client, or potential new client, with promises of full preparedness amidst an existential, hair-afire crisis, or warnings of one looming just over that next ridge.\n\nBoth types of playbooks \u2014 the immediate-need crisis playbook drafted on-the-fly during an active incident, and the \u201cproactive,\u201d sit-on-a-shelf crisis scenario playbook that will likely never see the light of day \u2014 aren\u2019t worth the high price tag PR firms are pushing them for.\n\nThere. We said it.\n\nPlaybook development typically involves months of staff interviews, production of half-baked drafts and far-fetched scenarios, and ultimately, an extensive internal review process to create a so-called \u201cfinalized\u201d document that will be outdated and irrelevant within six months, if not earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the crisis the client faced when they were sold the playbook idea has already quite likely outpaced the playbook\u2019s construction and the client has crawled out of the mire independent of the playbook\u2019s painful birth, or they\u2019ve suffered the consequences of months of distraction.\n\nPlaybooks are great for one thing in particular, and that\u2019s checking the \u201cCYA\u201d box. But at the end of the day, a playbook won\u2019t be of much practical use during a real-time event.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: Crisis communications playbooks are a great way for legal and PR teams to bill lots of time to develop a mammoth document, and then, when it looks to be just about ready for the bookshelf above the computer monitor, to then go through countless extra revisions that bump up billable hours all the more. These types of deliverables, while loved by C-level corporate offices, aren\u2019t really practical. They\u2019re instead jam-packed with complicated flowcharts for escalations that aren\u2019t all that realistic, fluffy language to explain the \u201cpurpose of the plan\u201d (seriously?), designs that serve no real function and lengthy appendices.\n\nPlaybooks are seldom worth the amount of time and trouble they cost to create.\n\nCrisis communications is part art, part science, part instinct. It is a craft that requires a team which looks at each immediately looming issue as a unique problem to solve \u2014 not something you can find thumbing through a massive pre-developed playbook.\n\nThere are instead a perhaps limitless number of ways clients can actually prepare for a crisis without breaking the bank.\n\nStress test scenarios without client input\n\nAll plans are good in theory, but what\u2019s more important is how a team actually interacts during stressful scenarios. One way to avoid surprises during real-world events is to test scenarios in which the client is as \u201cblind\u201d as possible. If a crisis team has a good relationship with their client, then the scenario will reflect a realistic circumstance.\n\nAllowing a client to pick apart a scenario in advance, or even to define the scenario on their own, is a disservice to the purpose of the exercise: How will you react to the unknown?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this time and again with clients: despite having developed an agreed-upon plan and order of operations, when a crisis occurs, executives opt to walk down the hall and talk to a colleague or hop on the phone, not follow a playbook\u2019s proper escalation protocol and ensure they are checking the appropriate boxes. The plain fact is, running for that book on the shelf over the computer monitor and then trying to determine which tab might be even peripherally relevant to a fast-breaking situation takes more time than just getting down to solving the immediate problem.\n\nThis is where scenario exercises really stress test how teams will function in reality. Crisis firms who understand the value of blind exercises may go so far as to have someone pose as a fake journalist inquiring about an issue unknown to the public to see how their client kicks things into gear. Do they contact their crisis team? Were the right internal teams looped in from the beginning? What are their first actions? (Of course, we never let anything get out of hand or pose external risk, but the exercise certainly gets their hearts pumping in a way that a planned tabletop exercise never will).\n\nKeep your relationship fresh\n\nA strong relationship with a crisis team will serve clients better during incidents than that playbook collecting dust on the shelf. Rumors spread instantaneously as truths, and a good crisis PR team must react even faster. This can\u2019t happen with a day-of phone call to a team you haven\u2019t spoken to in six months while the ship was apparently sailing blithely along, unaware of what was to come.\n\nTo successfully control the narrative, you need to already have a relationship with your crisis team. Schedule regular calls \u2013 even just one a month \u2013 to ensure you keep a pulse and remain up-to-date on any developing issues. Review positive press and social media references and mentions, looking for any hint of trouble lurking underneath. The more updated information your crisis team has, the quicker they will know not just how to respond, but how to navigate nuanced risks that come with each potential communications decision.\n\nBLUF, not fluff\n\nSo, what do you actually need to prepare for a crisis?\n\nRather than a lengthy document, there are a few key critical assets that should be easy to access and process, with as little \u201cfluff\u201d as possible. Crisis is no place for corporate buzzwords and introductions.\n\nHere\u2019s the short list of the essentials:\n\nA list of emergency contacts. Cell phone numbers, alternate email addresses (if needed for cyber attacks), and any contact information to know exactly who to call during a crisis. Escalation protocols. This isn\u2019t rocket science (or any other kind of science, really). Who needs to be informed first? When are HR and comms teams looped in? Who responds to media inquiries? When do you engage your crisis team? (Hopefully immediately..!) Draft holding statements. It\u2019s impossible to fully prepare for a crisis in advance because every scenario is truly unique and must be treated as such. However, developing brief 1-2 paragraph holding statements for the most common types of scenarios will save time during the internal fire drill, and give everyone a solid foundation to build other communications assets. What you do NOT want to build is additional assets, because these will end up getting scrapped or tediously line edited based on any edits to the holding statement. So, hold off, and focus on the big picture narrative you know you\u2019ll need.\n\nCommon scenarios to prepare for include: Data security incidents, unplanned executive exits, DEI/internal HR issues, natural disasters, workplace violence, employee deaths, and then, of course and most importantly, any issues unique to your organization that the public may not know about but could emerge in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, playbooks are so ingrained in the PR world that they will inevitably continue to be bought and sold. But for companies looking for real added value to a team, an ongoing relationship with a PR firm will serve them far better in the long run than the notoriously useless document we all know as the Crisis Communications Playbook."

This could involve \u201csabotage of critical infrastructure through digital or physical means, information theft, disinformation campaigns, cyber-attacks,\u201d the report noted.\n\nCriminals typically cooperate with state-sponsored hybrid threat actors either for financial gain and/or for shelter in safe havens.\n\n\u201cIt also allows these states to deny direct involvement by outsourcing certain crimes such as cyber-attacks, disinformation campaigns or even money laundering to criminal networks, making attribution difficult,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cThe outsourcing to multiple networks or actors might also be cost effective for state actors as criminal networks already have infrastructure in place and often have a global reach.\u201d\n\nRead more on state and cybercrime alliances: As Nation-State and Cybercrime Threats Conflate, Should CISOs Be Worried?\n\nEuropol highlighted the following as the most acute hybrid cybercrime threats:\n\nRansomware , which disrupts essential services and undermines public trust in institutions\n\n, which disrupts essential services and undermines public trust in institutions Data theft , which could provide information for espionage, economic advantage or coercion\n\n, which could provide information for espionage, economic advantage or coercion Disinformation via fake social media accounts, troll operations and manipulated news content, to influence political systems and undermine democracy\n\nAI Plays a Critical Role\n\nEuropol warned that digital world had become the \u201cprimary theater\u201d for organized criminals.\n\n\u201cThe internet is no longer just a platform \u2013 it is the pillar of a criminal enterprise,\u201d it said. \u201cCriminal networks are increasingly abusing digital infrastructure to carry out their activities with increased efficiency and scope in multiple ways: as an enabler, as a countermeasure, and as a target.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report went further, claiming that AI would play a growing role in criminal tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), making attacks even more scalable and harder to detect.\n\n\u201c[AI] can be used for hyper-realistic social engineering attacks using deepfakes or voice alteration, or can be taught to impersonate the mannerisms, writing style and background knowledge of a person,\u201d the report explained.\n\n\u201cAI can also be used to improve and automate criminal processes like finding new exploitable vulnerabilities, triaging stolen information or automating ransom negotiations or different forms of online fraud schemes, increasing the scale of attacks. Data theft will play an increasingly central role in different forms of cyber-attacks, given its importance in AI-driven attacks.\u201d\n\nIn the future, fully autonomous AI could \u201cpave the way for entirely AI-controlled criminal networks, marking a new era in organised crime,\u201d Europol added.\n\nAppSOC CMO, Willy Leichter, warned that AI is a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for organized crime.\n\n\u201cApplying these tools to online fraud exponentially expands the reach, personalization and credibility of phishing attacks and other scams,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor legitimate uses, AI needs to be monitored for quality and accuracy, but criminals don\u2019t need perfection to break through security filters and fool even skeptical end-users.

        "full_text": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nThis story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nBefore he was abruptly fired last month, Derek Copeland worked as a trainer at the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Dog Detection Training Center, preparing beagles and Labrador retrievers to sniff out plants and animals that are invasive or vectors for zoonotic diseases, like swine fever. Copeland estimates the center lost about a fifth of its trainers and a number of other support staff when 6,000 employees were let go at the USDA in February as part of a government-wide purge orchestrated by the Trump administration and Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nBefore he received his termination notice, he says, Copeland had just spent several months training the only dog stationed in Florida capable of detecting the Giant African land snail, an invasive mollusk that poses a significant threat to Florida agriculture. \u201cWe have dogs for spotted and lantern flies, Asian longhorn beetles,\u201d he says, referring to two other nonnative species. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people realize how much crap that people bring into the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could be back to pandemic-level issues for some goods if we don\u2019t fix this.\u201d\n\nDog trainers are just one example of the kind of highly specialized USDA staff that have been removed from their stations in recent weeks. Teams devoted to inspecting plant and food imports have been hit especially hard by the recent cuts, including the Plant Protection and Quarantine program, which has lost hundreds of staffers alone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s causing problems left and right,\u201d says one current USDA worker, who like other federal employees in this story asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a skeleton crew working now,\u201d says another current USDA staffer, who noted that both they and most of their colleagues held advanced degrees and had many years of training to protect US food and agriculture supply chains from invasive pests. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that is easily replaced by artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t your average people,\u201d says Mike Lahar, the regulatory affairs manager at US customs broker behemoth Deringer. \u201cThese were highly trained individuals\u2014inspectors, entomologists, taxonomists.\u201d\n\nLahar and other supply chain experts warn that the losses could cause food to go rotten while waiting in ports and could lead to even higher grocery prices, in addition to increasing the chances of potentially devastating invasive species getting into the country. These dangers are especially acute at a moment when US grocery supply chains are already reeling from other business disruptions such as bird flu and President Trump\u2019s new tariffs.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re inspecting less food, the first basic thing that happens is some amount of that food we don\u2019t inspect is likely to go bad. We\u2019re going to end up losing resources,\u201d says supply chain industry veteran and software CEO Joe Hudicka.\n\nThe USDA cuts are being felt especially in coastal states home to major shipping ports. USDA sources who spoke to WIRED estimate that the Port of Los Angeles, one of the busiest in the US, lost around 35 percent of its total Plant Protection and Quarantine staff and 60 percent of its \u201csmuggling and interdiction\u201d employees, who are tasked with stopping illegal pests and goods from entering the country. The Port of Miami, which handles high volumes of US plant imports, lost about 35 percent of its plant inspectors.\n\nNavigating the workforce cuts has \u201cbeen absolute chaos,\u201d says Armando Rosario-Lebr\u00f3n, a vice president of the National Association of Agriculture Employees, which represents workers in Plant Protection and Quarantine program.\n\n\u201cThese ports were already strained in how they process cargo, and now some of them have been completely decimated,\u201d Rosario-Lebr\u00f3n says. \u201cWe could be back to pandemic-level issues for some goods if we don\u2019t fix this.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment. Republican senator Joni Ernst, who has been a vocal backer of DOGE\u2019s efforts, previously publicly supported the USDA\u2019s dog training program and cosponsored legislation that would give it permanent funding. Her office declined to comment on cuts made to it.\n\nTwo federal judges and an independent agency that assesses government personnel decisions have already ordered that fired USDA employees be reinstated. Earlier this week, the USDA said that it was pausing the terminations for 45 days and would \u201cdevelop a phased plan for return-to-duty.\u201d But affected staff remain in the dark about their future, and the Trump administration has signaled it will fight court decisions to reinstate employees, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling one of the rulings \u201cabsurd and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nAs these legal and regulatory battles continue to play out, Hudicka says he anticipates a number of trickle-down effects to happen, such as local market wars over resources, which bigger cities and larger grocery chains will be better equipped for than mom-and-pops and rural communities. Hudicka says that allowing shipping containers to sit uninspected could also impact other sectors, as the delays will prevent them from being reused for other kinds of goods. \u201cThose containers are supposed to be moving stuff every day, and now they\u2019re just parked somewhere,\u201d he says.\n\nKit Johnson, the director of trade compliance at the US customs broker John S. James, also predicts prices and waste to increase. But what raises the most alarms for him is the increased likelihood of invasive species slipping through inspection cracks. He says the price of missing a threatening pest is \u201cwiping out an entire agricultural commodity,\u201d an event that could have \u201cnot just economic but national security impacts.\u201d\n\nDecimating the Department of Agriculture could even have consequences for US Customs and Border Protection, which deploys the dogs trained by Copeland and other staffers at the National Dog Detection Training Center. CBP works closely with the USDA in other ways as well, particularly at points of entry. The two agencies run the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program, but it\u2019s funded by the USDA. Many Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service programs do not rely on taxpayer dollars to operate but instead collect fees from importers and other industry players. In this way, it subsidizes some of CBP\u2019s agriculture-related activities. CBP did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs the fired USDA workers wait to hear whether their reinstatements will actually take place, ports are beginning to feel their absence. \u201cThere aren\u2019t as many inspections being done, and it doesn\u2019t just put us at risk,\u201d says Lahar. \u201cIt puts our farmers and our food chains at risk.\u201d"

        "full_text": "Hundreds of people lined a high-traffic highway next to a Charlottesville-area shopping center Saturday afternoon where they made it clear that a planned Tesla showroom \u201cis not welcome here.\u201d\n\nBut the Austin, Texas-based electric vehicle company owned by billionaire tech tycoon and Trump administration ally Elon Musk is coming nevertheless.\n\nDespite the public pushback, New York-based O\u2019Connor Capital Partners, the owner and developer of the Shops at Stonefield off U.S. 29 north of the city, said it has no intention of breaking its lease with Tesla, put together three years ago and executed back in October.\n\n\u201cThe agreement with Tesla was established several years ago as part of our long-term plan to bring innovative businesses to the local economy and facilitate Stonefield\u2019s growth as a welcoming destination for commerce,\u201d O\u2019Connor said in a prepared statement sent to The Daily Progress.\n\nCompany spokesman Kevin Pryor told The Daily Progress that discussions with Tesla over a a potential \u201cgallery\u201d began in 2022. Five years prior, O\u2019Connor installed Tesla \u201csuperchargers\u201d at Stonefield, meaning the plans for the gallery predate the recent controversy over Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is cutting \u201cwasteful\u201d federal jobs and programs with zeal in Washington.\n\n\u201cElon Musk is a maniac taking a chainsaw to all parts of the government that help normal people,\u201d Lorie Craddock told The Daily Progress at Saturday\u2019s 300-strong \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d rally which she helped organize.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said Musk has saved taxpayers more than $100 billion. Those savings have come at the expense federal workers. Job cuts have hit the Department of Education, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, among others.\n\nWorkers have been targeted nationwide but have had a disproportionate impact on Virginia, which is home to the second-largest population of federal workers with 144,483.\n\n\u201cPeople are unhappy with the Republican administration, and Americans have a long history of protesting and speaking up, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here today,\u201d said Craddock.\n\nCraddock is a part of Indivisible Charlottesville, the local chapter of a national progressive movement which launched in 2016 in response to the first Trump administration. Indivisible organizations across the country have been holding rallies in the wake of Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nThough the O\u2019Connor statement stresses the company \u201cvalues community feedback and engagement,\u201d it is clear that it will not be swayed by any number of protesters wielding signs reading, \u201cWhat the cyberf-ck\u201d and \u201cEw, who would buy a Tesla now?\u201d The showroom is set to open sometime in the second quarter of the year, which begins in April.\n\nThe environmentally friendly vehicles were once popular among environmentally minded progressives, but that changed after Musk allied himself with Trump. Now former fans have rebranded the vehicles \u201cswasticars,\u201d a portmanteau of \u201cswastika\u201d and \u201ccars\u201d and a reference to Musk\u2019s gestures at a Trump rally that resembled a Nazi salute.\n\nSince that incident, Musk has also appeared virtually at a rally for German far-right political party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, or AfD, which aims to reclaim the \u201cV\u00f6lkisch\u201d movement, the nationalist movement from which the Nazi Party sprung.\n\nTesla employees and shareholders are grappling with the consequences of a chief executive entwining himself in politics. Stock shares in the company once worth $1 trillion have plummeted 41% since last year. The same day as the \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protest, it was reported that Tesla was the worst-performing stock of any of the top 100 S&P companies valued at $100 billion or more. As of this writing, Tesla shares were worth $238, a significant drop from the $480 they traded for in November.\n\nAttendance at Saturday\u2019s \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d was considerable, however some of its participants acknowledged that it was unlikely to effect real change \u2014 at Stonefield at least.\n\nJonathan Kern said he believes the protests held across the country hold a certain emotional benefit for participants who may feel disheartened by the chaos and upheaval.\n\n\u201cIt gets people out,\u201d Kern told The Daily Progress on Saturday. \u201cWe need more action, and I don\u2019t mean defacing Tesla cars. We need to be out in the communities, showing who really cares about communities and who really cares about people.\u201d\n\nPeople \u2014 particularly members of the Democratic Party \u2014 have gotten \u201clackadaisical\u201d over the past few years, according to Kern, a former civil servant. Many felt that a second Trump presidency \u201ccouldn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said, but since that impossibility was made possible, he hopes people will learn from the havoc being wrecked on the country\u2019s economy and diplomatic relations to \u201crealize there\u2019s better ways.\u201d\n\nOne group that may soon feel the repercussions of the administration\u2019s cutbacks is the nation\u2019s military veterans. A memo from the Department of Veterans Affair on March 4 orders the agency to \u201creturn to our 2019 end-strength numbers of 399,957 employees.\u201d The department, which provides benefits, medical care and other services for veterans, currently hosts a workforce of around 482,000, a quarter of which are veterans themselves.\n\nThe potential fallout for veterans was enough motivation for Svonne Stickley to attend Saturday\u2019s \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d rally. Her father, Pvt. 1st Class Roland Stickley, was drafted into the infantry during World War II and instilled in her the lesson to \u201ctake up for people who can\u2019t take up for themselves.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s fearful that Veterans Affairs will be dissolved, leaving veterans to cover their own health care and medical resources from the private sector.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m out here supporting my father that can\u2019t be here, and I know that if he saw me today, he would be proud that I\u2019m supporting veterans,\u201d she told The Daily Progress. \u201cThis is my very first protest, and it\u2019s because I\u2019m so passionate that I actually decided to come out and do something like this.\u201d\n\nA handful of Trump and Musk supporters were also in attendance Saturday. Four Albemarle County High School students, two of whom were decked in \u201cTrump 2024\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d paraphernalia, walked among the protesters, occasionally engaging in heated verbal exchanges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supporting the community, supporting Elon Musk,\u201d one of the students told The Daily Progress.\n\nAnother declared their intention was \u201cto piss off some liberals.\u201d The group, all of whom were ineligible to vote due to their age, declined to provide their names.\n\nPhilip Hamilton, a local Republican who has unsuccessfully run for the Virginia General Assembly on two occasions, also showed up at the rally wearing a MAGA hat to the displeasure of some protesters.\n\nHolding a sign above her head that read, \u201cMy father fought in WWII against dictatorships,\u201d Svonne Stickley drew several parallels between Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime and the current political climate.\n\n\u201cHitler was putting the Jews in concentration camps. It\u2019s very similar to the way Trump is sending Mexicans to Guantanamo Bay,\u201d she said, referring to the president\u2019s mass deportation program. \u201cThey\u2019re living in inhumane situations, and it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\n\nShe noted that Trump has, once again, aligned the U.S. with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom she described as a \u201cdictator.\u201d\n\nThough Russia\u2019s constitution technically outlines the government as a federal republic, the country has been in the throes of democratic backsliding as Putin has refused to relinquish control since 2012.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump halted all military aid to Ukraine, which has been fighting a Russian invasion for three years. Trump has echoed Russian propaganda regarding the war, falsely claiming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy started the war that has left his country destitute and cost the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians."

Callaci, who is a historian of modern Africa, illuminates the time her subjects spent in Africa and the Caribbean, and its influence on their politics. James, born into a radical working-class Jewish family in Brooklyn, married the Trinidadian Marxist historian and activist C.L.R. James and lived with him in Trinidad before settling in London. Teaching in Zambia, Wilmette Brown was disturbed to find that the World Bank made aid conditional on population-control measures, and equally disturbed by the social pressure that resulted in women having more children than they wanted. Margaret Prescod grew up in Barbados in the final years of British colonial rule. Her ancestors\u2019 unpaid labor had enriched the United Kingdom and the United States; now, their descendants moved to those countries and worked long hours for low pay\u2014often while their children remained in Barbados, cared for by grandmothers and aunts.\n\nCallaci\u2019s initial interest in Wages for Housework, however, was personal rather than academic. As a teenager in the 1990s, she absorbed the idea that \u201cmy liberation would come through education, creative expression, and professional success\u201d\u2014in other words, through escaping housework, not identifying with it. But when Callaci had her first child, she realized escape was impossible. Wages for Housework gave her a language to understand her new circumstances, yet she retained some ambivalence about whether she did, actually, want what the campaign demanded. Did she want to think of herself as raising future workers, whose labors would support capitalism? Like my students, she worried about imagining the time she spent with her children as a job, and the expression of her love for them as something that had financial value. (Wages for Housework campaigners would counter that Callaci\u2019s, and my students\u2019, discomfort was discomfort with the workings of capitalism; wages for housework merely makes those workings visible.)\n\nCallaci was not the wife of a factory worker imagined in some Wages for Housework material, or the single, Black, or immigrant mother imagined in others. She had a full-time job as a history professor and a male partner with whom she split the housework. Even so, counting the second shift, she was working 18-hour days. Furthermore, she was only able to keep her paid employment through outsourcing childcare\u2014and then only because the women who cared for her children were paid less for their work than she was for hers. This too was part of the Wages for Housework campaign: drawing attention to the fact that the success of some women in the workplace, often touted as a measure of equality, was made possible only through the undervaluing of other women\u2019s work at home and abroad."

        "full_text": "This paper is primarily a defense of my claim that Iraq is divided by an ancient curved escarpment stretching between Hit and Samarra. This geological formation is shown to be a relict shoreline where the post-Flood waters rested after the earth dried up. The Griffith and White challenge to this does not hold up; they mistakenly claim that the close-by and far more recent Tharthar depression in Iraq is what I am referring to. There are implications for the location of the Tower of Babel in this disagreement; those who erroneously believe that the Tower was built in south Iraq do not understand that the entire area below the escarpment was under water when the Tower was built. The southern half of Iraq is a delta that was formed by sediments from the Ice Age meltdown, and all structures built on it are post Ice Age. Therefore Babel and Babylon are not to be confused; the former was built in Northern Mesopotamia and the latter was located in southern Iraq, south of the Hit\u2013Samarra escarpment.\n\nKeywords: Iraq escarpment; Tharthar depression; Persian Gulf shoreline; Tower of Babel\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe recent paper by Griffith and White (2024) claiming that I have made a major geological error in my paper on the location of the Tower of Babel (Habermehl 2011) is itself greatly in error. Griffith and White have confused the geologically recent Tharthar Depression in Iraq with the ancient post-Flood escarpment that lies between Hit (also called Heet) and Samarra. The escarpment and the Tharthar Depression are two different geological formations that happen to be located near each other, as will be shown below.\n\nWhat is the Hit\u2013Samarra Escarpment?\n\nThe escarpment is an ancient curved ridge that stretches from near Hit on the Euphrates to just below Samarra on the Tigris in Iraq (see fig. 1). It divides Iraq in half. The territory south of this escarpment is the alluvium of Iraq, a deposit that was washed down from the Turkish mountains to the north and the Zagros mountains to the east in the Ice Age meltdown to form a delta. There is a distinct difference between the northern and southern parts of Iraq (Habermehl 2011).\n\nThere are geologists who believe that this escarpment is an ancient shoreline that would have marked the head of the Persian Gulf at a distant time in the past. This escarpment was noted by De Morgan in 1900 as a reconstructed head of the Gulf between Hit and Samarra 8,000\u20135,000 years ago (Sissikian et al. 2020). Also Lloyd in 1943 showed that the Head of the Persian Gulf was about 108 km NW of Baghdad before 4000 BC. This is basically the same location as the Hit-Samarra line) (Sissikian et al. 2020).\n\nIn addition I quote from my Babel paper (Habermehl 2011):\n\nThere is an important geological feature in Iraq that runs roughly east\u2013west from the Euphrates to the Tigris, north of Baghdad, from Ramadi (near Hit) to Samarra. This curving ridge or escarpment, about 6\u201315 m (19\u201349 ft) high, is located at an altitude of about 76 m (249 ft) and is considered to be an ancient ocean shoreline (Boesch 1939; Guest 1953; Held 2000, p. 337; Lloyd 1955, pp. 16\u201317, 29; Maisels 1993, p. 87). The altitude of this ridge is significant because it sits right in the range of 70\u201380 m (229\u2013262 ft) where the ocean shoreline might be today if all the global ice on land melted, as already noted.\n\nFig. 1 shows how this feature, described by Ragozin (1893, p. 1) as \u201ca pale, undulating line,\u201d and by Held (2000, p. 337) as \u201ca sinuous cliff, probably the feature for which Iraq is named,\u201d divides Iraq into two parts: the northern section (called al Jezirah, meaning \u201cthe island\u201d) that is desert and rocky, and the southern delta, the alluvium, that is quite different in character (Aqrawi, Domas, and Jassim 2006, p. 22; Johns 1913, p. 13; Potts 1997, p. 2 map). About this cliff, the nineteenth-century traveler, Rawlinson (1885, p. 3) wrote:\n\n\u201cBut nature has set a permanent mark, half way down the Mesopotamian lowland, by a difference of geological structure, which is very conspicuous. Near Hit on the Euphrates, and a little below Samarra on the Tigris, the traveller who descends the streams, bids adieu to a somewhat waving and slightly elevated plain of secondary formation, and enters on the dead flat and low level of the mere alluvium. The line thus formed is marked and invariable; it constitutes the only natural division between the upper and lower portions of the valley; and both probability and history point to it as the actual boundary between Chaldaea and her northern neighbor.\u201d\n\nFig. 1, mentioned in the quote above, is in the Babel paper, and is reproduced as fig. 1 in this paper. Together the references in the above quote constitute strong evidence for the existence of this escarpment. These referenced authors do not consider this ancient escarpment ridge as nonexistent, as Griffith and White claim in their seriously flawed misunderstanding of geology. In addition, the references in that paper for what the altitude of the ocean would be if all the ice on earth melted are Alley et al. (2005) and Poore, Williams, and Tracey (2000).\n\nWhat this shoreline was becomes clear if we look at it from a biblical point of view. If all the ice now on earth melted, the ocean level would rise to where the waters settled immediately after the Flood. That just happens to be the elevation where the escarpment lies (as noted above). I show this clearly in the Babel paper. Did Griffith and White miss this, or did they not understand it? Either way, they are wrong in claiming that I am in error on the escarpment.\n\nThis ancient shoreline dates from the post-Flood settling of the water, about 2,350 years (MT) or 3,300 years (LXX) BC. However, on the extremely stretched-out secular timeline, Noah\u2019s Flood was at least 235 million years ago, because the dinosaurs first appeared then after the Flood (Norman 2017, 6, 9). This would put the formation of the escarpment at least that far back in time on the standard secular timeline.\n\nWhat Is the Tharthar Depression?\n\nThis depression, mistaken by Griffith and White for the escarpment ridge shoreline, was formed some time in the Holocene (a period between 11,700 secular years ago and the present) (Sissilian 2011; Walker et al. 2009). In other words, it formed post Ice Age. This is a lot later than the end of the Flood when, as I show above, the escarpment would have formed. (How much later depends on whether we are calculating according to the MT or LXX). As I have shown in past writings, the Ice Age ended some time before Abraham (for example, Habermehl 2013). This makes the Tharthar depression relatively recent in earth\u2019s history compared to the escarpment. (The depression is in the same place as the current artificial Lake Tharthar that was formed in 1956) (Sissakian 2011). It appears that this lake formed in the depression that is located just north of the escarpment.\n\nThe Tharthar Depression is shaped like an enclosed drop-shaped bowl; by comparison, the escarpment is a ridge that stretches from Hit to Samarra. The two are two quite different formations and it is difficult to see how they can be confused. The depression was formed by the process of karstification (Schultz n.d.; Sissakian 2011). Fig. 1 in my Babylon paper shows that the escarpment line is sharply curved below the depression.\n\nThe roughly east\u2013west width of the depression is 48 km (Sissakian 2011). However, the direct distance as the crow flies from Hit to Samarra is 115 km (Travelmath 2024), more than twice that distance. If you drive the curved road between the two cities, the distance is 180 km, which shows how sharply curved the road around the bottom of the depression is. Either way, the width of the Tharthar Depression is a great deal less than the length of the escarpment between Hit and Samarra.\n\nIn fig. 1 of the Griffith and White reply to Osgood (2024), their red line drawing of the bottom edge of the Tharthar Depression is very inaccurate. Their line incorrectly shows the Depression reaching almost from the Euphrates to the Tigris Rivers. However, the actual size of the Depression, as I show above, is less than half that distance.\n\nIn addition, there is a difference between the two formations in that the southern rim of the depression faces north while the escarpment ridge faces south.\n\nThe Point of This Reply\n\nGriffith and White have misunderstood the geology and have mistaken two very different formations for each other. Their characterization of my work as a \u201cbad argument\u201d is not acceptable. The ancient Hit\u2013Samarra escarpment and more recent Tharthar Depression of Iraq are two totally different geological formations that must not be confused.\n\nI therefore stand behind not only the escarpment in Iraq as an ancient shoreline, but I also stand behind the entire thesis of my paper on the location of the City and Tower of Babel.\n\nReferences\n\nAlley, Richard B., Peter U.

Their relationship soured in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it was halting sales in the West Bank.\n\nThe dispute escalated over the last year as Ben & Jerry's advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nIn November, the ice cream company filed a lawsuit saying Unilever had tried to stop it from expressing support for Palestinian refugees.\n\nLast month, in another court filing, Ben & Jerry's said Unilever had tried to ban it from publicly criticising Donald Trump.\n\nMr Stever has been with Ben & Jerry's since joining the firm in 1988 as a tour guide. He was appointed chief executive in 2023.\n\nBen and Jerry's court filing said the decision to oust Mr Stever was made without any consultation, as required in the merger agreement between the two companies.\n\n\"Unilever... attempted to force the independent board into rubberstamping the decision,\" it added.\n\nThe Unilever spokesperson said: \"In line with the terms of the acquisition agreement, decisions on the appointment, compensation and removal of the Ben & Jerry's chief executive will be made by Unilever after good faith consultation and discussion with the B&J's Independent Board.\"\n\n\"We hope that the B&J Independent Board will engage as per the original, agreed process,\" they added.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lily Jamali"

        "full_text": "Home, it is often said, is where the heart is. But in today\u2019s increasingly unpredictable world, ensuring that home is also a place of security is vital. The answer is not in seeking high-tech, futuristic solutions but in rethinking the fundamentals of household safety and security.\n\nRedefining Traditional Security Systems\n\nMany households still rely on traditional locks and keys, a method that, while familiar, offers scant resistance against the criminal craft. Securing doors and windows may seem basic, but it\u2019s a first line of defense often underestimated. Reinforcing these entry points and using deadbolt locks can significantly reduce the risk of break-ins. Sliding doors with insecure locks are invitations for intruders; a simple rod or broom handle can add an extra layer of security inexpensively.\n\nMoreover, evaluating the vulnerabilities within your home environment can be an enlightening exercise. Consider the landscape around your property: are there dense trees or bushes that could serve as hiding spots? Trimming these can improve visibility and reduce concealment opportunities. Adding fences or thorny shrubs around windows acts like a natural barrier, enhancing physical deterrents with a touch of strategic landscaping.\n\nThe Alert Factor: Lighting and Surveillance\n\nDarkness is the ally of mischief-makers. Proper illumination is not only a deterrent but also an effective way to make a statement: this home is occupied and under observation. Motion-activated lights serve as a surprise element for any potential intruder and add an extra layer of alertness around your property. Meanwhile, cameras are no longer accessories of luxury homes. Positioning them at vital points can serve dual purposes: deterrence, as their mere presence often discourages criminal activities and evidence collection.\n\nAnother often overlooked aspect of maintaining a safe home environment is managing pests that may contribute to security issues. For those mindful of such concerns, employing effective methods like a pest prevention service can keep unwanted visitors, such as termites and other pests, from compromising the structural integrity of your home. In this way, maintaining a safe and secure interior environment becomes a comprehensive practice.\n\nA strategic combination of light and shadow can redefine perception. Think about varying the intensity of light across different parts of your property, ensuring no area remains completely hidden. On the same note, not all surveillance needs to be visible. Hidden cameras can capture authentic activities even in the presence of mischievous elements. Integrating these devices with reliable alert systems ensures timely notifications, fortifying your home\u2019s defenses.\n\nHome Environments: Not Just Secure From Intruders\n\nIt\u2019s not just man-made threats that concern homeowners; natural hazards lurk as well. Fire alarms and smoke detectors, often assumed to be part of standard home safety, are frequently neglected when it comes to maintenance. Monthly tests and battery replacements are minimum efforts required to avoid devastating consequences. Furthermore, installing carbon monoxide detectors is a wise precaution, especially in homes with gas-powered appliances.\n\nDe-cluttering your home, particularly exit routes, can be a lifesaver during emergencies. Teach family members the importance of maintaining clear pathways and bonding around fire drills, nurturing a proactive culture. Additionally, pay attention to excessive moisture that could signal leaks or flood risks. Identifying and rectifying these issues promptly can mitigate substantial water damage, blending safety habits with household care.\n\nCybersecurity: A Household Imperative\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the unseen digital threat. As households embrace increasingly connected devices, the cyber environment becomes eerily relevant to physical security. Robust passwords and regularly updated software are recipes for safeguarding interconnected systems against potential breaches. Recognize that hacking doesn\u2019t solely target corporations; any data can be valuable.\n\nChildren accessing the internet create another layer of vulnerability in our tech-imbued homes. Parent engagement, coupled with educational efforts, empowers young minds to recognize and steer clear of online threats. Tools like firewall protection and parental controls go a long way in nurturing a cyber-resilient home environment. Ensuring healthy technology use while imbibing an awareness of digital privacy builds robust future firewall guardians.\n\nCultural Shifts: Community Vigilance\n\nOne cannot understate the importance of community vigilance. The phenomena of \u201cneighborhood watch\u201d may appear antiquated, yet it encapsulates invaluable communal efforts. Neighbors watching over one another strengthens the social fabric while broadcasting a united defense against wrongdoers. Building trust within communities encourages collective security, transforming individuals into a coordinated line of defense.\n\nTo amplify community-driven safety measures, consider bringing together groups for shared activities. Simple gatherings, like barbecues or gardening events, allow neighbors to bond and exchange vital safety information. Foster a collective awareness, building a resilient network where everyone knows everyone\u2019s faces, routines, and safety measures. As whispers of change stir through these collaborations, unity against potential threats emerges as a natural deterrent.\n\nConclusion\n\nRethinking household safety and security should not be an ordeal, nor solely a technical exercise. It requires a return to basics, a certain art of being prepared yet not paranoid. In essence, the strongest security measure one can deploy in the home is awareness\u2014of measures that work, and of those that masquerade as innovations but add little value. In this multi-faceted endeavor, the old and the new must join forces to safeguard what we cherish most: our sanctuary."

Scottish Enterprise and the UK government\u2019s Office for Investment will work with Petroineos to market the proposals set out in Project Willow and seek investor interest.\n\nIt follows the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement last month of \u00a3200 million to help unlock Grangemouth\u2019s full potential. First Minister John Swinney also announced \u00a325 million to establish a Grangemouth Just Transition Fund, which will support businesses and stakeholders to bring forward investible propositions over the next 12 months for the site.\n\nEnergy Minister Michael Shanks said:\n\nWe committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth. This report and the \u00a3200 million investment by the UK government demonstrates that commitment. We will build on Grangemouth\u2019s expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors, secure a long-term clean energy future, and deliver on our Plan for Change.\n\nScottish Secretary, Ian Murray, said:\n\nThe publication of the Project Willow report and the options it sets out marks a significant milestone in our commitment to deliver a long-term, sustainable future for the Grangemouth site which benefits the local community and the Scottish economy. Working alongside the Scottish Government and local partners, we remain committed to supporting the skilled workforce at Grangemouth, and are already working to attract investors for the projects outlined in this report. The Prime Minister recently announced a \u00a3200 million investment in Grangemouth through the National Wealth Fund which followed the \u00a3100 million Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal, delivered jointly with the Scottish Government. Scotland is at the centre of our Plan for Change as we become a clean energy superpower over the next few years.\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney said:\n\nWe will leave no stone unturned in order to secure the future of the Grangemouth refinery site, and the Scottish Government has already committed or invested a total of \u00a387 million to help do so. Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors. Everyone working at Grangemouth\u2019s refinery \u2013 and in the wider industrial cluster - is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland\u2019s economic and net zero future. This report sets out a wide range of viable alternatives for the refinery site, demonstrating that a long term, new industrial future at Grangemouth is achievable. We will continue to work closely with the UK government to realise these opportunities and Scottish Enterprise stands ready to support inward investors looking to progress any of these technologies.\n\nAlongside launching a search for investors, both governments have also committed to review the Project Willow policy recommendations and understand how government funding can be deployed to mature proposals from the private sector.\n\nThe \u00a325 million Grangemouth Just Transition Fund and \u00a3200 million from the National Wealth Fund for co-investment are on top of existing investments to ensure the long-term economic future of the Grangemouth area and support the workforce. These include:\n\nthe \u00a3100 million Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package, delivered jointly by the Scottish Government and UK government, to support the community and its workers by investing in local energy projects to create new opportunities for growth in the region\n\njoined up support from the Scottish Government and DESNZ to provide tailored skills support for refinery workers, this includes a training guarantee for all Grangemouth refinery staff to ensure that any worker who would like skills training at the local college is supported, with funding provided by the UK government - this will help workers into new, good jobs with local employers\n\nBackground information\n\nThe 9 projects include:\n\nWaste: hydrothermal upgrading (breaking down hard to recycle plastics), chemical plastics recycling, ABE biorefining (breaking down waste material)\n\nbiorefining (breaking down waste material) Bio-feedstock: breaking down Scottish timber into bioethanol, anaerobic digestion of bioresources and digestate pyrolysis, HEFA (conversion of Scottish cover crops into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using low carbon hydrogen)\n\n(conversion of Scottish cover crops into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using low carbon hydrogen) Offshore wind conduit: Replacing natural gas with hydrogen, using low carbon hydrogen to produce methanol and convert it to SAF , producing low carbon ammonia from hydrogen for shipping and chemicals\n\nAny National Wealth Fund investment will be subject to investible propositions and the Fund\u2019s criteria \u2013 the proposition must deliver a positive return, drive regional and economic growth or support activity to tackle climate change, invest in key sectors, and crowd in private finance.\n\nFind more information on investment opportunities.

Read our privacy policy\n\nThrust into the limelight in her 20s as her debut single Kids In America stormed to number two in the UK singles chart, Kim Wilde was thrown into the temptations of the music industry at an early age.\n\nBut now at the age of 64, the Brit Award-winning pop star is proud of the way her younger self handled fame, even if she did allow herself a few indulgences.\n\nThe singer has recently released her 15th studio album, Closer, and is currently touring the UK to promote the record, which is inspired by her 1988 LP Close.\n\nCloser sees Wilde present a collection of new wave-tinged pop, and includes the singles Trail Of Destruction and Midnight Train, as well as a collaboration with Ultravox singer Midge Ure called Sorrow Replaced.\n\nSince her breakthrough single, she has even turned her hand to gardening, winning a gold award at the Chelsea Flower Show for her courtyard garden in 2005.\n\nSpeaking about her early days in the music business, Wilde, whose father is 1950s rock and roller Marty Wilde, says: \u201cI became a pop star very young, and I was thrown into the heart of it, but most of that was wonderful.\n\n\u201cIt was meeting lots of great people, meeting all my idols, traveling all over the world, having a lot of success, and the opportunities that it brought, I mean they were all great gifts, and I recognise them for that.\n\n\u201cOf course, I did get caught out with a few bad habits, especially with alcohol, I think over those years, it was just a mainstay of most events after a gig, before a gig, at a party or anything.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s just I took a decision after abstinence for a while.\n\n\u201cAnd noticing how well I felt during that abstinence, it was a Stoptober thing, just before I stopped alcohol, and I felt so alive and so healthy, and a lot of small health ailments seemed to disappear, and I thought, this is can\u2019t be a coincidence.\n\n\u201cSo I thought I\u2019ll just keep going and so nine years later, and I\u2019m feeling very much better, I know, now, than had I not made that decision.\n\n\u201cBut I had a lot of fun during those days, I don\u2019t regret much, I\u2019m really proud I never got into drugs at all, ever, not remotely.\n\n\u201cI think that could have really destroyed me.\u201d\n\nShe credited the likes of The Pretenders\u2019 singer Chrissie Hynde, Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry and the late Kirsty MacColl for inspiring her when starting out, saying the latter had \u201ca big influence on me as a songwriter\u201d, adding that she knew the singer and liked her \u201cvery much\u201d.\n\nWilde also praised modern artists such as \u201cclever\u201d songwriter Taylor Swift, and drew similarities to her own career with that of Billie Eilish, who works with her brother Finneas O\u2019Connell, having worked with her own brother, Ricky, and father on Kids In America.\n\nThe singer said there had always been strong women in music since she began, but said there needed to be more female representation in executive positions in the industry, saying the situation \u201chasn\u2019t changed as much as it could\u201d.\n\nShe says of the issue of power between musicians and industry bosses: \u201cYou do have to stand strong against executives, whether they\u2019re male or female, or male or female artists.\n\n\u201cPeople in positions of power sometimes don\u2019t handle it very well, and you have to be very wary and stand your ground, because you have what they want, more than they have what you want.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the power, and you have to recognise that and really acknowledge it, and sit with it, and treasure it, and guard it completely.\u201d\n\nWilde has scored eight UK top 10 singles throughout her career, including Chequered Love, You Keep Me Hangin\u2019 On and You Came, and has also achieved two UK top 10 albums in her self-titled debut and Close.\n\nShe prompted hilarity when she teamed up with late Not The Nine O\u2019 Clock News star Mel Smith to record a cover of Brenda Lee\u2019s festive track Rockin\u2019 Around The Christmas Tree in 1987, with the record reaching number three in the UK singles chart.\n\nFast-forwarding to the present day, the Chiswick-born star says she has been \u201camazed\u201d by \u201coutstanding\u201d reviews for her latest record.\n\nShe continues: \u201cThat has been a really wonderful thing to have at this stage in my career, to be 64 and have an album that\u2019s been received so positively and enjoyed, and the fact that we had so much joy making it ,and now performing it live.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a phenomenal phase of my life, that\u2019s kind of come out of quite a lot going on in my personal life in the last few years.\n\n\u201cAnd then to have something so positive come out of something, I wouldn\u2019t say difficult, but there were some challenging things going on in my life in the last few years, and then to have this thing of beauty emerge out of it, it\u2019s phoenix-like.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing, I\u2019ve got a wonderful gift, I\u2019m really looking forward to sharing it with everyone live, because that\u2019s where it\u2019s really going to come together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got this amazing band, and we\u2019re just itching to get out there and present these new songs alongside the old ones, and all the old hits.\u201d\n\nWilde says the new record and supporting tour is \u201cmuch sweeter\u201d having come off the back of a number of health issues for her.\n\nShe explains: \u201cFirst thing that happened was I slipped a disc, and I was in a huge amount of pain, and that went on for several months, until I managed to recover via a whole variety of things, which did not include surgery.\n\n\u201cAnd after that, I started training to strengthen my core, to make sure that it might never happen again, which is ongoing.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m still doing that, but in the last year or so, I also got affected by Covid quite badly, and that happened several times, and really knocked me out, and has lowered my immune system. I really battled to get on top of that.\n\n\u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m back to full strength right now, but I have had a bit of a hammering with that.\u201d\n\nWilde is currently touring the UK with performances at London\u2019s Indigo at the O2, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall and Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, before moving on to Europe in March to perform in countries including Sweden, Belgium and Germany.\n\nTickets for the tour are currently on sale."

We'd like to see.\"\n\n'Not for exclusion'\n\nUnlike his brother Prince Ali - who runs Jordan's football federation - Prince Feisal is against banning Israel from sport.\n\n\"I'm not for exclusion,\" he said. \"I believe in inclusion. And right now, the only reason for anybody to be banned is in violation of the Olympic charter.\n\n\"And although people have different opinions on it, as long as there is no violation of the Olympic charter, then I have no reason to ban anybody. We have to respect the Olympic charter as a precedent.\"\n\nGet Sky News on WhatsApp Follow our channel and never miss an update Tap here to follow\n\nWe speak before the latest outbreak of war in Gaza, but with concerns already growing about Donald Trump's calls for Palestinians to leave the territory.\n\nThe US president suggested Jordan take in Gazans to \"clean out that whole thing\" after the war turned the territory of 2.3m people into a \"demolition site\".\n\n\"It should be what the Palestinian people want, not what the rest of us [want] - we should not be in a position to take decisions on behalf of other people,\" Prince Feisal said.\n\n\"We are against forced movement or migration of any people from their territories and it's something that we firmly believe in.\"\n\nAnd Prince Feisal, who has held military roles in Jordan, insists Mr Trump is \"somebody I can work with\" as Los Angeles prepares to host the 2028 Games.\n\n\"I hope this is the start of a movement towards peace in and of itself,\" he said. \"Peace is not created by stopping wars or having ceasefires.\n\n\"It's created by building hope, a sense of justice, a sense of fairness. These are all critical elements that need to be there in order for peace to really exist.\"\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\n\nPrince Feisal is currently vice chair of the IOC's gender, diversity and inclusion commission.\n\nSo how does he feel about women's sport in Afghanistan being banned by the Taliban?\n\nHe said women being able to partake in sports in Afghanistan is \"something I would very much like to see but at the end of the day, every country is its own, has its own sovereign rules and its own decisions.\n\n\"I would encourage them to allow women to participate in life because I think that is in part embedded in the very principles of Olympism.\n\n\"But I can't force people to change laws just because I believe it is wrong. It's up to them to understand that this is actually for their benefit.\"\n\nSo Afghanistan's participation at the Olympics is not at risk over lack of gender equality - despite the IOC Charter being used to ban Russia over the war on Ukraine?\n\n\"I think to ban them on that principle alone would require potential change to the Olympic Charter,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not something I've personally looked into, but I believe it would require a change in the charter. And then it's up to the IOC members if they agree and the consensus is there and that's what they do.\"\n\nLA 2028 will see transgender women banned from women's sport if Mr Trump gets his way - even by denying athletes visas.\n\n\"What we need to look at is a scientific-based approach on eligibility, to make sure that [it] is both fair and safe for all the competitors involved in that sport,\" he said.\n\nBut unlike Lord Coe, the prince does not advocate a blanket IOC ban - leaving the issue of gender eligibility to each sport.\n\n\"The international [sports] federation is in a far better position to make that determination than the IOC,\" he said.\n\n\"Could you imagine if the IOC started taking decisions on these issues, for instance, over FIFA?\""

Welcome to Crazy Town where shooting lasers at the moon reminds us of a simpler time.\n\n\n\nMelody Allison\n\nHi, this is producer Melody Allison. Thanks for joining us in Crazy Town where Jason, Rob, and Asher tackle crazy-making topics like climate change, overshoot, runaway capitalism, and why we're all deluding ourselves. Here's a quick warning: sometimes this podcast uses swear words (Language!). Now on to the show.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nOkay, guys, before we get to the conversation we're gonna have today, can we just do a little like nostalgia tour? Would that be okay with you?\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nThat's all I want to think about is the past.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nI want to take you back to the 80s.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nYes.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nThat's my decade.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nMid to late 80s. Back in the days where I had like a real long mullet.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nYou were beautiful, I'm sure.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nIt was a mane of hair. It was incredible.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nIt's still amazing.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nBut, you know, bangs up top.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYeah, did you wear leg warmers and a jean jacket?\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYes, I did. And I would watch Victoria Principal Jazzercise videos.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nWho did the Maniac video?\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nOh, I don't remember. Any case, but I'm glad you're bringing up music. This is what I wanted to get to because I was prepping the other day for an event that we're going to be doing on April 1.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nOh, I thought you were like, getting your beans and grains together, or something like that.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nNo, no, not that kind of prepping. Prepping for this event. So I'm going to be hosting a conversation with Vanessa Andreotti and Dougald Hine. We'll be talking about navigating the end of modernity, right? And I was reflecting on that word modernity, and for some reason, you know what, came to my mind? You won't be able to get this ever.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nNo, no one can get inside your mind other than you. You're just gonna have to reveal it.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nThe album Quadrophenia.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYeah, The Who.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYeah.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nI mean, I don't know it super well, but I'd recognize tons of songs, I'm sure, right away.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nBut just time out for a sec. You said you were going back to the 80s, I'm pretty sure that was pre 80s.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nNo, I'm talking about me listening to it. Okay. I've gone through phases with music, right? So I had my little Who phase, and The Who, like some other bands, like to do these rock operas. So Quadrophenia was basically a rock opera. The whole album was like one story. In fact, they made it into movie later. Quadrophenia was basically about these guys, you know, these teenagers, and they were part of this group called the Mods, like mod for modern. And they liked to dress up in these, like fancy suits. They called them zoot suits. And they were right around on Vespas. For some reason, I don't know, that album came to mind, so I had to go down memory lane listen to it, which is a lot of fun. But it made me think of something I wanted to ask you guys. Which is, albums, you know, I used to listen to albums. I would get these albums. I would buy them. I would save up my money, and I'd go buy these albums. You know, in opening up the album, reading the liner notes, sitting there, listening to it, like repeatedly listening to albums over and over and over again, you know? My boys, the way they listen to music is, I don't even know if they've ever -- I'm sure they've listened to an album all the way through, but they don't experience music as an album, right? They just experience it as a sort of instantaneous thing on their phone, you know? So maybe think of elements of modernity that have actually already left us, right? They're extinct already. And I know vinyl is not totally extinct.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nIt's coming back.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nBut that experience feels like it's largely extinct, you know? So curious what you guys, what piece of modernity of your previous life that's now gone would you say you miss?\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nThat's a really interesting question. It's like modernity technology is evolving so fast that some of it's just already gone. Even though you would still classify it as being a modern thing. Well, I'm gonna stick on the music scene for a little bit. Not not specifically the music, but the way that that you tune your radio. So do you guys remember how car stereos used to have these mechanical buttons, and you would actually chunk it in, you would push it in, and the little dial would move to your presets. I just love that -- That was fancy. That was incredible -- tactile, mechanical feel of some old stuff. And in fact, I have this problem, right? Like, you know those sinks that you put your hands in, and they're, like motion sensors, or somehow they know your hand is there? Like they don't recognize me. I don't know. I don't think I put off a stong electrical field.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYou're a ghost, man.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nOh, I know what you're talking about. For washing your hands.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nAnother example would be all these push button things, like a microwave or a stove.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nWait, those don't work for you either? They don't recognize you?\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nA lot of times they don't. So I'm just like, can I just get an old mechanical dial? They work so well.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nThis is why you use an Easy Bake Oven, isn't it?\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYeah, yeah. I just eat everything raw. There's no point in trying to cook.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nThere you go. What about you? Jason.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nWell, okay. Since we're on food, on Easy Bake, Chuck E. Cheese pizza time theaters. Do you remember those? Now, there was one not far from my house in Cupertino, California. They experimented with this Chuck E. Cheese, a different business model. And it was the best because you paid one fee to get in, and all the video games were just open, and all the pizza was just laid out for you. So you just, you show up with like your 10 bucks, or whatever.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYou were there all day?\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nAnd you could have unlimited games, unlimited pizza, and unlimited, like, animatronic shows.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nUnlimited brain rot when you're leaving.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nAs an 11-year-old, do you have any idea how great that was?\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nSo that was your version of TikTok, basically. It was the unlimited --\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nYeah. Unbelieveable. I'd just go there for hours.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nInteresting. Well, thank you for going down memory lane.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nUnlimited sodas, too.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nOf course they had sodas. Okay, well, thanks for going down memory lane with me. But I would want to have actually a more serious conversation about modernity, if we can. And I thought we should bring in somebody who's been thinking about this a lot more than I have, I would say, and that's our good friend, Tom Murphy. So what do you guys think about us seeing if Tom would would join us?\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYeah, we're gonna bring him in.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nLet's go.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nAnd I'm gonna introduce Tom, because he is our favorite astrophysicist.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nHow many astrophysicists do even you know?\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nEverybody needs a favorite astrophysicist. Tom's a professor emeritus from the University of California, San Diego. I don't know that I can get this right, but he used to test general relativity by bouncing laser pulses off of these mirrors that were left on the moon by Apollo astronauts.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nAll of these things are lies. I mean, there's so many things you just said didn't actually happen, but okay, I'll just pretend.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nAnd I genuinely love hanging around Tom as a friend. Asher, you and I got to spend some time at his house, and Tom took us out kayaking.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYeah, that was fun.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nAnd I think I was even paddling a kayak that Tom had built, which is incredible.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYeah, and you did drown or anything. It was amazing.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nI don't know, Asher, you were probably doing some work, but Tom took me back to his workshop and showed me the project that he kind of does in his spare time, where he's the Co-inventor of this aircraft detector. So the idea is that telescopes are shooting lasers into the sky, and you don't want to hit an airplane that's passing by. You'd get a hole through the airplane? Yeah, just cut it right in half. So Tom's got this thing that he made. He's like soldering parts on a computer. I don't know. I can't even use the terminology right.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nWe should talk about this because Elon Musk's DOGE will come around and just cancel that contract.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nRight. But anyway, after spending time in that world, you know, what's really interesting is Tom's turn toward the limits to growth. So anyway, let's get you in here Tom and find out what's what.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nSure, just send me the link and I'll show up.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nOh my gosh. He's here.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nIt's a miracle.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nYou happened to be free.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nThanks for joining us, Tom.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nSure.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nSo we want to throw this question that we've been asking ourselves: Extinct modernity, right? So I had Chuck E Cheese pizza time theater. Rob and Asher, I don't even remember their stuff. It was stupid. But anything that happened in the past that's now extinct that's part of modernity. What's your favorite?\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nWell, I really liked the discussion that you had. And you know, at first, I thought things like the space shuttle and the Concord represented a vision of where we thought we were going. And in fact, I put the space shuttle on the front of my textbook. And I didn't ever explicitly mention this, but in my mind is, where the hell does it think it's going? You know, it just sort of seemed like we all knew what was happening. I miss the the extinct threat of nuclear war.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nI'm glad it's extinct. I didn't even know that.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nIt's coming back, Tom. It's coming back.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nI know, but didn't we have this period where that was just no longer on the radar.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nRight. Ohhh. You miss when we thought it was extinct?\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYeah, I misinterpreted that too. I thought we got real dark there for a second.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nLike I love the duck and cover drills that we used to do.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nSomewhat intentionally, you know, playing both sides there. But you know the radio button discussion, you know, still, when you design a GUI, which I've done a number of times, there's one choice for radio button. You know, because you can only select one of the boxes at a time, and that still harkens back to that mechanical, you know, push this thing and the dial actually zips to where you want it to go. And tha reminded me of, well, dialing is a thing that we still talk about on the phone. But there's no dial anymore, which is great, because, you know, if you had a number with a lot of eights and nines in it, you're waiting forever.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nIt was terrible.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYeah, your friends never called you.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nThis about the delayed gratification when you were making a 1-800 call to order whatever the album, Asher, that you were buying off a TV\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nFrom Time Life.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYou had to really want that album.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nZeros are the worst. And how many of our youth know? That zeros were terrible. So you know an area code, like 212, whoa. That was a special -- Yeah. So anyway, but it reminded me of observatories because I cut my teeth, in a sense, at Palomar Observatory on the 200 inch telescope, which is just a marvelous machine. It's really a piece of art. It's crafted. It's lovingly made. It was made during the depression years, and things slowed down a lot, but that meant that they took their time. Well, and they just did things differently in any case. And then you go to a telescope like the Keck telescope, you know, which I also worked at in Hawaii, which is a modern 10-meter telescope, and it just seems rickety. You know, the stair, just the stairs that you're walking on, the hand rail doesn't feel very substantial. It's all just sort of cutting corners. But the thing that reminded me of the Palomar was the radio button, because Palomar had this great thing called the Phantom. The Phantom was this mechanical analog to the telescope that was, you know, recognizably telescope shaped and it sat in a little sort of cabinet. And it mimicked the actions of the telescope. So, it moved as the telescope did, just mechanically through whatever moved the telescope, moved the Phantom. But the reason they had the Phantom was they needed to know where to point the dome. And the dome was -- Basically, the Phantom had two wires on either side of it. And if it touched one wire, it would say, \"Oh, we need to move the dome this way to keep it aligned. \"So, it was a very mechanical, ingenious solution. And, you know, since then, they've replaced it with barcode scanners. So, you know, they have barcodes all around the periphery and a little scanner so they always know where it is. And I don't know what the price accumulates to during a night as it beeps and, you know, adds up the items, but you know, I really missed that age when you had this really clever mechanical approach. And now it's replaced with more computerized things that can fail. And when they fail, it's hard. Like cars, also. I miss the car that I grew up, starting when I was 16 and started to drive, was a Chevy 1974, Chevy pickup truck, with a six-cylinder inline engine. And I am not exaggerating when I say that you could stand in the engine compartment with your feet on the ground next to the engine on either side, because you had that much room. And now you look at a car, and there are about 12 things in between you and the pavement. If you shot a laser, you know, you would hit 12 things. No matter where you go, it's just so completely packed, there's no standing in it. And there was just a simplicity. You could point to everything and say, \"That's what this does, that's what this does,\" and you could fix it. Now, when something breaks, it's kind of irreparable. Planned obsolescence. Yes. All in the name of efficiency.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nWell, so Tom I wanted to invite you into a conversation with us before we actually do this event that we're going to be hosting with Vanessa and Dougald because I know you've been on a bit of a journey around modernity and it's been interesting as someone who's been so steeped in it, I would say, to see you go through that journey a little bit. But before we get to that, maybe, I'd be curious how you define modernity, like if somebody asked you. Because I would think for a lot of people, they don't even know what we mean when we question it.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYeah, at some level, I kind of like the ambiguity of the term, because it doesn't have baggage yet associated with it. And so, people are more willing to entertain the idea that modernity has a time limit, and that it's temporary. And there are a lot of things about modern life that people don't like and wouldn't mind seeing going. So, if you say civilization, people have a much greater attachment to that word, because it feels like the opposite is barbarism and violence, and that's a false kind of dichotomy. But the point is, modernity doesn't have that kind of emotional attachment, and so it can mean many things. It's obviously how we live today. It's our culture, it's fossil fuels, it's high energy, it's high material use, it's science, it's technology. And these things have been with us for, you know, centuries, but not millennia. But I would actually, in my mind, I extend modernity to, I mean, there are different ways to think of it, but it's also an attitude, it's an approach, it's a culture. And it's a culture of believing in mastery of we are the pinnacle species, the evolutionary end point, if you will. And this is all kind of a mythology, a cultural mythology, and I borrow heavily from Daniel Quinn's Ishmael here, where our mythology is that the world belongs to us, and you know, we were made to rule it and conquer it and master it. And once you have that attitude, which is pretty old -- that's older than modernity -- thousands of years.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYeah, that's older than modernity.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nThat is the central shift that paved the way for modernity because we just got better and better at enacting that attitude. But the attitude is thousands of years old, not millions like humans, or hundreds of thousands like Homo sapiens. And so, it's relatively new, and certainly in ecological evolutionary timescales, it's a flash. Even 10,000 years is a flash. So the agricultural revolution was one of conquering. It was one of control. It was deciding what should live and what should die, plants and animals. And it's all for us. It belongs to us -- Fences, animal enslavement, all kinds of things came with it. And then we just got better and better at it, and perfected the art of control. And science really helped that technology, really helped that fossil fuels, really accelerated it so, you know, but I don't see those elements as major turning points. The turning point was, I think, a much earlier one that really set the stage for modernity. And we've been that recognizable culture ever since. We don't identify culturally with, say, hunter gatherers, but we sure identify with a Mesopotamian. You know, we understand what they were after and how they approached the world. So that, to me is the big definer of modernity is, it's our attitude of how we comport ourselves on this planet.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nSo Tom, I don't want to like ascribe some attribute to you, but you know you're talking about the, you know, how we enacted this attitude of mastery and this art of control, but you were kind of ensconced in an arena that was really playing out that story, right? I mean, you're in an astrophysics department. You're doing things that are, you know, super, super high tech. I mean, honestly, I mean, I'm still, I find myself impressed, right? Like, I'm like, wow, you built this thing. Or, you know, how do you know how to do that? You know, I remember asking you that in your workshop. And you just talked about tinkering a lot with things as a kid, and just being really interested in it. Being steeped and at a place like that, in the university system, and kind of being in that culture in a big way, how did you get out of that? What's the journey to, you know, to saying the kinds of things that you just said, where you're recognizing this human supremacy in this culture that maybe won't work. One does not logically follow the other. So I'm curious, how did you get there?\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nI mean, I was definitely fully invested. I mean, I was all in as a member of modernity, doing exactly what you would hope a member of modernity would do. You know, shooting lasers at the moon. That's everybody's dream, right? So I think the way I see the journey is that I was always interested in understanding the path that we're on and trying to imagine where things are going. I grew up with Star Trek in the next generation as a teenager, and really loved it. And I think, you know, I never liked the original Star Trek because it just seemed too campy and nerdy. And I was not a real nerd kid. I only learned to do that later. But I really liked Spock because my family was so illogical. The guy was a beacon of logic, and so I really aspired to have that mental discipline and so forth. And so I think that was really influential. And I really loved the sort of fantasy world of, you know, the prime directive and all this, you know, enlightened future that we could embrace. And, you know, this was our path. And I was not questioning that really. It was exciting. The space shuttle was exciting. Here's, you know, our path into the stars and so forth. But, you know, as a kid, and now I associate those ideas with juvenile fantasy, right? And it's almost surprising to me to see the other people who have become adults and are still, you know, still there.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nIncluding the richest among us.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nAbsoletely. I mean, the biggest blind spot you can imagine. So, I think I was always interested in the future, and so I knew that energy was an important part of how we get things done. I mean, as a physicist, I clearly understood energy, and sort of physics owns energy, to some extent. And so, I was interested in teaching a course my first year at UC San Diego on energy in the environment. It's a general education course for non-science majors. And I thought, I'll pick this one. You know, I had a menu of what courses would you like to teach, and so nobody had claimed that one. And then I thought I would learn a lot. And I did. You know, I already knew that solar was so abundant that it's almost a no brainer that, of course, we'd just switch to solar when fossil fuels go away and it helps the CO2 problem and everything. So, you know, done, right? A simple premise and a simplistic, stripped down, decontextualized world has very simple solutions. And so it just seemed pretty obvious. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized it's hard. And I did my own solar setup. And I started small with one panel and a battery and a charge controller. And then I said, what about this other kind of panel, and this other kind of battery, and this other kind of charge controller, and let me just sort of get my feel for this. And I put just my television on it at first, and then I got another panel and another battery and put the living room lights on it. And then I thought, you know what'd be really cool is to run my refrigerator off of this. So more panels and more battery, and, you know. And it basically was an off grid system. And I was in a condo at the time, and, you know, had the landlord's permission to put a hole through the wall for an extension cord. And so I was just really kind of crude, but I learned so much, and the energy became very personal because I worked so hard to get it. And so watching TV, and I learned this was back in, you know, in a cathode ray tube, and it turns out that the darker the movie, the less energy it takes. Because you're lighting up the electron beam les. And that's not true now with, you know, LCD TVs where you have a backlight that's just full on, and then you have things to suppress the light coming through, but there's some variance on that. But still, I learned so much about living with your own energy, and the difficulties of off grid storage, intermittent power supplies, what do storms mean, what do, you know, periods of bad weather mean? But my approach was, let's technology our way out of this. You know, we're smart and clever people, and this is what we do. But the more I looked into it, the more I realized how much of a kind of House of Cards this whole business was and how there were some glaring weak spots. You know, growth itself is just a non-starter for long term success. But even at steady state, you can't maintain a steady state at billions of humans living a modern lifestyle. It's just a temporary stunt. So yeah, the more I realized -- And it's sort of came to closing exits, one after the other, where I just always assumed that we would figure it out. And now I've gotten to the point where I realize how naive that vision is because, you know, we construct mental models in our brains that -- Our brains are limited, by the way. I mean, they're organs. They're evolved to do certain things, and they do certain things pretty well, and they give us flexibility, but they're limited. They have, you know, only so much capacity, and something like an evolved ecology is so complicated and so many interconnections and dependencies and relationships that we barely scratch the surface of understanding. Our brains are just incapable of the kind of wisdom that an ecology expresses that's formed over deep time. And we're just simply incapable. And I think of it kind of like the ravenous bug bladder beast from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide. That's so stupid that if you to evade it, all you have to do is cover your eyes, because it figures if you can't see it, it can't see you, right? But we're almost as bad as that. Because if an ecology can't see its way into our brain, we assume it doesn't exist. And there are a lot of things that don't fit into our brains, into our mental models. Most things don't. And so we have this bias toward our models, toward the map and not the territory, so that we assume if it doesn't fit in our brain, it might as well not exist. And you'll see this all the time with, I don't see why not, is a common response to why we won't go to Mars, or why we won't keep modernity going forever. I don't see why not. It's like, yes, that's precisely the problem, you know, but thanks for admitting it. That's very big of you and an important step to realize that you don't see why not, and that's okay. We're not expected to see everything.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nI think you're right that that is actually progress for someone to say, \"I don't see why not.\" Because a lot of what we see, we had a conversation not too long ago talking about this series of articles that the New York Times published on the future of the food system. And one of the things we talked about was that you start from these assumptions of how things must be, and then you try to figure out how those assumptions are going to get fulfilled, right? So, the assumption is people are going to continue to want to live in the desert. We're going to still need to consume the food the way that we do. It's like, of course, more people in the future are going to be consuming more energy. Like, that's just obvious. And so we just have to figure out how to how to solve that problem, versus questioning whether or not that assumption is even true in the first place.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nRight. Yeah. I mean, the world doesn't bend itself to our will, which is why we've thought we had to conquer, you know, when the pests come in to eat our row crops. We have to, you know, how dare they? That's ours. We have to do something about it. And so, yeah, the universe is really not on board with just making sure that our schemes work. And you know, it's going to fight back.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nOne of the things that I have trouble with continually is knowing all this and then still living in modernity and wondering, you know, is there a way where I can start practicing or trialing post modernity ways of life.And it becomes really hard to do. I often joke that I'm sorry I didn't grow up as a Romanian peasant because I was spending time with Chuck E Cheese pizza time theater instead of, you know, learning how to do all the things that someone as a kid would just normally get up and do. And so, when you see people from these other cultures, and I know Rob has a fan, he's like watching some of these YouTubes of these people that like, know how to live out in nature and have these incredible skill sets. And what do I do? I teach tennis. I teach kids how to hit a fuzzy yellow ball with a graphene racket and and poly strings on a concrete court with painted lines. I love doing it. It's a lot of fun. But I almost wish, like, could these parents pay me to teach their kids to do something else? But it's not just not part of our culture, right? It's like, it's easy money to teach people how to play tennis, but if you say, I'm going to try to teach us and learn how to live without all the trappings of modernity. You know, it's just like, good luck. That's not much of a viable business, I don't think. Or maybe it is. Maybe I should try that. But I don't think I'd get very much interest, honestly. So what do you do? What do you do? Like, you know, as somebody who grew up in all this and knows the BS, but you don't have the skill set, and the vast majority of people around you aren't even interested.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYeah, I think I look at the longer game here, because I don't think I am personally going to exit modernity. I mean, I'm steeped in it. It's all I know. I don't have the skill sets, or, most importantly, the community, because it's not an individualistic approach. We're not the rugged individuals we pretend to be. We're a species that's, you know, contextualized to group survival and working cooperatively within that fairly small band. So that's very unlikely to ever be my reality. And I don't stress about it too much. I don't think that by next week I have to be out. You know, it's not going to happen, and modernity took a while to build. It's not going to necessarily take 10,000 years that it took to get to this point to unwind, but it can take generations. And it will take generations. I mean, some things will go away fast, and then some things will, you know, cling for for maybe centuries, recognizable elements of modernity. And each child that's born into the conditions that exist at that time will just accept those conditions as normal and get on with life. We're very plastic and adaptable, not necessarily as individuals, but as a species because we're just sort of almost blank slates, but with some decent instincts that are honed by evolution to work together, to be cooperative, to be observant, to be creative in how we adapt to a changing situation. And so that's, I think, going to be the story. And the people listening to this don't have to stress about not getting it right and propagating this machine. But the thing that I try to do most is just, I'm no longer in love with modernity, and talk of it as an abusive partner that said nice things to me occasionally and brought me flowers, but really, you know, at the cost of a sixth mass extinction. And so, there's kind of this dark side to it that I shouldn't really embrace. And so, I just don't care to propagate all of those trappings. And I can dial it down. I don't have to stop it, but I can be part of the off ramp by just sort of not playing the game the same way, not being a consumer, not supporting fantasies politically.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nThe problem is, it's hard not to be a consumer. I mean, Asher gets pissed off every time he's like, \"Oh God, I've gotta order something from Amazon.\" And he's just mad. He's just mad because he's like, I don't have another -- What choice do I have? And I kind of feel like, every once in a while, my family says, \"Can you please go pick something up at Safeway?\" And I'm just like, \"Argh.\" And then they know, like, I'm gonna break out in hives when I walk in and see the mylar balloons, you know, right in the front because of whatever holiday is coming up, and the stacks of soda cans. So it jars me. Like you're saying, it's like, you know, oh, do I have to go back into this abusive relationship here and just dip my toe in it continually. And that's kind of what it feels like. Because I sort of see through what it took to fill this store up with, you know, all this junk, all this cargo, and I'm mad sometimes because I feel like everybody around me is in this cargo cult, and I don't want to be there all the time. So I guess, you know, you find your ways to sort of stay out as much as you can, is what you're saying, even though you you can't help it a little bit. Because, like you say, we're really a social species, and so without -- Like I said, if I had 50 kids that wanted to learn something besides tennis, but I don't. So what do I do? Right?\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYeah, well, I know what you do, Jason. I know you go look at birds.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nYeah, I do, yeah.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYeah, exactly. And that's fantastic, because they don't care about tennis, and they don't care about what's in Safeway, yeah. And if you ask them about what's going on in, you know, Trump world right now, they don't care. And there's a wisdom there. And I'm not being flippant about the word wisdom here because a wisdom that took millions upon millions of years to establish itself and establish itself as survivable, as you know, a presence, has gotten a lot of things right. And the fact that the birds, and I see newts around my place and love them to bits, and I really take a lesson from the fact that they're just living by the laws of life. So what we've done is we've created an artificial world out of our brains. And I think of modernity as a big brain fart. You know? And I might be a little hesitant to use such foul language on any other podcast, but you guys, you know, I've listened to your show. So yeah. I mean, it's just this concoction, this fabrication that's not grounded and doesn't have the same kind of wisdom. It's just sort of a look what I can do stunt. No hands. Wow, look at that. The animals and the plants don't go in for all that, and they're better for it. And so we ought to actually take something from that and realize that we can't just make it all up on our heads and expect it to work.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nJason, you would be one of those bowerbirds that is pulling mylar balloons and plastic spoons and other stuff to build your nest.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nI sometimes wish I was a bird because then I could just fly around and I could land in that tree, and I could take my little beak into the lichen and moss and find little bugs and, you know, make a little nest and yeah. You know, they just know how to live in that forest or whatever, or stick their bill in the ground and pick out things. I can't even see what they're eating. I know they're finding food. You know, who does that around here are the orioles when they make their nest. It really bums me out.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nWell, they're just, you know, they're, working with what's in the environment. Yeah, the thing that I appreciate what you said Tom just about not beating yourself up for participating in modernity, but also maybe practicing some sort of detachment, I guess a little bit. I feel batted back and forth between feeling trapped, frankly, in the reality that we currently live in, when I know, to the degree that I do the consequences of it. will you end already? You know, like I have sometimes this sort of this impatience though. I don't want it to end, and certainly not end badly or quickly. I also, I think there are moments where I deeply appreciate the benefits we've had from modernity and like wanting to appreciate it as much as I possibly can if I recognize that it's fleeting.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nLike Quadrophenia.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nNo, like we're able to have this conversation and not be in the same room together. It would be much more lovely, frankly, to be in a room together. But I am fortunate in my work to have conversations on a weekly basis with people all around the world that I would have never gone to meet or learn from. That's an absolute gift of modernity. So . . .\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYeah, or when you have a tooth problem, you go to a dentist. You don't have to, like, knock it out with a rock, you know? That's a pretty sweet deal in modernity.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nThat's true. But the other thing that I really struggle with is the fact that we're actually on an acceleration path with modernity still, or at least the technological elements of modernity.\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nYeah, AI stuff.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nAnd in fact, I feel like the people, you mentioned that maybe modernity as a concept is more it's less loaded for people as something to question than something like civilization, right? Because that feels more threatening to them. And I see that. I think people are increasingly feeling the ill effects of how modernity manifests itself in their lives now. I mean, you look at, we talked about the food system earlier, you look at just the deeply unhealthy nature of the modern food system and what it's doing to people's bodies, I think. But also communications technology, the internet, social media, these kinds of things. I think that might actually be the fact that it's accelerating so much, and it's so ubiquitous, and it's sort of conquered us on some level. That might be the actual thing that has people be more receptive to a message of modernity coming to an end. They may not recognize that it's going to come to an end, whether we fucking like it or not. But, they may be more open to thinking about it ending because they're seeing that it's not benefiting them as much. I don't know.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYeah, I do think a lot of people are aware that things aren't quite right, and that things are maybe going a bit sideways, and the dream is not being fulfilled. I believe that, you know, 75 years ago, it was fairly widespread sense that we're aiming for, you know, ever better world. We're going to craft it. We finally have the tools to craft it the way we want. We have the energy and the power, and it hasn't gone so well. And it's also, by the way, initiating a sixth mass extinction, which is pretty serious, because a heavy primate that is high maintenance and, you know, hungry, is not going to fare well in a six mass extinction scenario. Short of that, you said that like it or not, modernity is going to end. And that's absolutely true. And even just from a materials point of view. I mean, you know, we've taken the low hanging fruit in just a few centuries, and most of it in the last 50 years. I mean, the pace is extreme. And so, you can't really keep this pace up for even 1,000 years, 10,000 years. So modernity will starve itself of metals on that time frame. And the other thing that I recognize is that, you know, the materials that we use in modernity are not of this ecological world. We dig them out of the ground, and they're not part of the circulation in the community of life that we use. In fact, 96% of our mass comes from air and water, reconstituted, reorganized. But the, you know, the oxygen, the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, is all from air and water. And then only 4%, you know, a lot of calcium, phosphorus --\n\n\n\nJason Bradford\n\nPotassium.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nPotassium, yeah, are in common circulation in community of life. But not copper, not magnesium. Well, little, tiny bit of magnesium. But, you know, titanium.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nWell, you know, trying to put that into our bodies as much as possible, Tom.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYeah, exactly. Yeah, aluminum, you know, these are weird, exotic things that we're spewing. You know, maybe not intentionally, maybe not, you know, immediately, but if it comes out of the ground, it ends up in the environment, You know, on the Millennium timescale that's just out there. And the community of life doesn't know what to do with it. And sometimes it's innocuous, but more often than not, it actually causes problems. And so not only are we going to starve ourselves of these metals if we tried to continue modernity, but it's contributing that their use and dispersal contribute to sickness and ailing in the physical world, biophysical world. So yeah, we don't really have a choice to continue it. It's not a long-term viable mode of living on this planet. I think you know in terms of giving it up or letting it go, a little bit of detachment goes a long way. That's something that can be a little bit contagious in the sense that we take cues from each other in our culture, and we're a social species. And so, if a number of us react to this sense that things aren't going according to the dream, and that the dream was never realistic, maybe more detachment among more people will have pretty serious consequences and will kind of get out in front. All the video, you know, TikTok and whatever is part of the phenomenon that detaches us from ourselves, and that is having consequences in terms of fertility. And so we're going to see this big demographic shift in this second half, or maybe even the first half of the century. We'll see possibly a peak of global population, and it's going to be big news. And how we react to that is going to be fascinating. I mean, some people are saying we just need to make more babies. Elon Musk is on like, is on the job, man. He's trying to make as many babies as he can right now. That's right. And, you know, JD Vance, similar. I mean, a lot of these folks are like, we need to become baby factories. But I don't think it's gonna work, and so But then some people will embrace it and say, \"You know what? This is actually -- maybe we can make this into a good thing.\" And so that's kind of where I am on it.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nSo Tom, I really appreciate the way you framed the idea that modernity is a temporary stunt. You know, it's like a Red Bull mountain biker coming down a cliff, doing a double back flip without touching the handlebars, or whatever. You know, it's like, \"Wow, look what we can do.\"\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nOr the show \"Jackass\" comes to mind.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nWell especially when I'm talking it does. I actually can't believe that I'm not talking about the other thing. You called it a big brain fart. That's more up my alley, but anyway, this this idea of a temporary stunt, and then falling out of love with temporary stunts like, you know, eventually kind of saying, yeah that's fine that I could do that, but did I really need to, you know, and at what cost? And so, you know, I've heard your recommendation is try to detach yourself from that. But what I'm wondering that maybe you could share with listeners is, how do you talk to other people about that? Do you just tell them about your experience and what's happened with you to kind of start what you called a contagious detachment. Like, how? How do you, you know, let's say you're wandering around the physics department at your university, and people are like, this is not on their radar whatsoever. I mean, how would somebody out there broach the topic and start to make some headway? You know, what does Jason tell his tennis students, you know, that gets them on a path towards wanting to be birds as well?\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nSo I was reminded of a, and by the way, before I forget this one, you talked about, you know, being enamored of the stunt and falling out of love with the stunt, but you also prefer brain fart. So you need to fall out of love with the smell of your own brain fart. I mean, people like their own brand sometimes, but you just -- That's disgusting. So yeah, I was reminded of the secret handshake kind of thing where I had a friend who moved to Utah. It was a couple who moved to Utah. And he was describing, you know, it's Mormon country, and he's not Mormon, but he was saying that when you plan some event with somebody who you barely know, you're just trying to get to know people, and you're trying to find a time when you can do something. You're like, well, Saturday, I'm doing something, but what about Sunday? And you just totally float out there because if they're Mormon then absolutely not. And if they're like, \"Yes, Sunday would work,\" You're like, \"Great, let's be friends.\" You know? It's like, you like cream soda? I like cream soda too. We'll be best friends. So, um, yeah, it is kind of like that.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nSo we need certain like secret words or secret signals to the other modernity questioning people.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYeah. because I would have my ears out and, you know, listen for any hints from other people. And I would drop some hints, you know, about how I think about things. And occasionally you'd run into somebody who catches the hint, and then you start talking. But it's not something that I could walk up to anybody in my department and just sort of have an interesting, fruitful discussion about modernity and its temporary nature. And same among my friends. I mean, I've got a lot of really good friends who basically just don't want to talk about this stuff and d I don't push it, you know, because I want to stay friends. And I had a friend that came from, you know, that I hadn't seen in 30 years. A college roommate who came and stayed with me and his wife, and, you know, it was great fun to catch up. And I might have dropped a few little hints of where I am now, but I didn't really want to burden that fun experience with, oh, by the way, here's why I think this is all going, you know, south. So I don't know. It is a bit isolating. AnI was thinking about that Asher, when you were talking about how you're able to connect with people internationally. But I think when you're in such a rarefied place of having this view, you kind of need that community, and you need to go far and wide to find it.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nThat's true, yeah.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nBecause, you know, you can't just go to your next door neighbor and expect to connect over this kind of issue.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nWhen they complain like traffic's bad, you can't go, Yeah, and civilization is collapsing. It doesn't really work, does it?\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nWell you can if you want to end conversations quickly, which is what I like to do sometimes, you know, because I'm an introvert and I don't like people. I think it's a good recommendation, maybe for our listeners, who obviously -- The ones who bother to listen to more than one episode I think are folks who kind of are inhabiting the same sort of space as us, and maybe this is a secret handshake kind of community that they're also part of. So, what I'm taking away is not riddling ourselves with guilt, not expecting ourselves to completely detach, but to maybe detach a bit emotionally or in terms of our identity to what is modernity now. And then, maybe, you know, dropping little seeds every once in a while in interactions with people that maybe some people pick up and ask a question about it. You know, I think even just naming things as not being permanent can be useful.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nWell, and we make decisions all the time that might have some long-term ramifications, like. Like, you know, the road that I live on is private road, and it's in fine shape. It was paved, you know, probably 30 years ago. And it's okay. It's a light use road, but at some point it'll need resurfacing. And it makes sense to resurface it if modernity is just continuing for a long time, but a lot of things don't make sense anymore if it's just a temporary stunt. And that's what part of the falling out of love is about. It is in the detachment. It is recognizing that, wait, why am I doing this thing if our future doesn't look like what we were all told our future was going to look like. What does it really mean, and why am I doing this? And so that that's a big part of it is always asking yourself, why am I doing this in the context that this is temporary.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nYeah, I guess a takeaway I'll throw out there is that falling out of love with modernity just opens up more space to fall more deeply in love with the complexity of the ecosystems that you inhabit.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nYou bet.\n\n\n\nRob Dietz\n\nI try really hard to be observant of what's going on in the places that I inhabit. And observant of the things nature is doing, not observant of all the hubbub of modernity. And it's hard to do, but I think the more you can focus on that, the healthier you are, and the more in the future you'll be able to make decisions like, yeah, let's not resurface this. Let's let it return to a path and eventually to a forest, or whatever it's going to be.\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nI appreciate you coming and sharing this with us, Tom. Just a little bit about your journey and the way that you think of it. I think it's inspiring and hopeful for me to know someone who I would say, you could have been very well excused to have stayed embedded in modernity, you know, considering the work that you're doing, what you studied, and all that. And for you to not only step out of it and question it, but I think in what you do at Do the Math, your blog.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nWhich you started by the way. You realize that?\n\n\n\nAsher Miller\n\nYeah, no, we talked about that. You did it, nan, that's all you.\n\n\n\nTom Murphy\n\nNo, but that's part of the journey. And I forgot to mention it.

        "full_text": "Formosa Town in India: Telangana establishes industrial zone for Taiwanese firms amid geopolitical shifts\n\nIn a significant development for Taiwan-India economic relations, the Allegiance Group has signed a major project cooperation agreement with the government of Telangana state in India to establish the first \"I.T.I.P\" Taiwanese industrial zone within the state's \"Future City\"(Net Zero City) project.\n\nThe initiative aims to gather Taiwanese foreign direct investments, with multiple companies already signing letters of intent for investment. This strategic shift reflects growing geopolitical concerns, with Taiwanese companies gaining unprecedented governmental support in India through comprehensive administrative assistance.\n\nThe groundbreaking collaboration was formalized during a press conference at the Indian Taipei Association in Taipei, witnessed by Ho Chun-hsin, President of the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce in India, and Manharsinh Yadav, Director General of the India Taipei Association.\n\nDirect land ownership creates competitive advantage\n\nThe initiative, spanning 14,000 acres within Telangana's \"Future City\" project, offers Taiwanese investors significant advantages through a specialized industrial park operated by Allegiance Group, which holds permanent land ownership rights\u2014a notable departure from the leasehold arrangements typically available in other regions. This strategic structure comes alongside substantial state-level incentives including construction, logistics, and workforce training subsidies specifically designed for Taiwanese businesses.\n\n\"The land for this industrial zone is held under permanent ownership by Allegiance Group, providing long-term security for tenant companies,\" explained Simon Lee, chairman of Allegiance Group. This comprehensive infrastructure hub will be complemented by \"Formosa Town,\" an ecological community designed for expatriates to enhance the relocation experience for Taiwanese professionals.\n\n'China+1' strategy and Trump 2.0 concerns drive investment\n\nJasper Liu, chairman of Optimus Technology, one of the electromechanical engineering firms that signed onto the project revealed that geopolitical factors are significantly influencing Taiwanese business strategies. \"This is partly due to the potential impact of a 'Trump 2.0' policy,\" Liu explained. \"It suggests that investment in supply chains could shift toward mitigating geopolitical risks. Therefore, we are aligning with this strategy by setting up production and sales bases in India in advance.\"\n\nLiu's company, which specializes in electrical equipment and power supply systems, has already established operations in India and plans offices in key areas like Anjar and Hyderabad. \"We have established a presence in Taiwan, mainland China, Thailand, and India. Next, we may expand southward to Indonesia and Malaysia,\" he noted, underscoring the broader \"China+1\" diversification strategy being adopted by many Taiwanese firms.\n\nTwo-pronged market approach strengthens investment case\n\nThe strategic value of the Telangana initiative extends beyond geopolitical hedging. \"A major factor is the significant involvement of Taiwanese businesses in India's development. This presents a substantial business opportunity for us,\" Liu stated. His company plans to first serve existing Taiwanese businesses in India before expanding into the domestic market.\n\n\"We aim to gain a first-mover advantage,\" Liu explained. \"Since we specialize in electromechanical engineering, we will follow Taiwanese businesses into this sector. This allows us to prioritize securing projects already developed by them.\"\n\nInfrastructure and policy support drives momentum\n\nA total of 11 Taiwanese companies have already signed up for the initiative, including Join It Sustainable Tech and Ever-Master Machinery. The group comprises four service firms, five electronics companies, and two non-electronic manufacturers. This collaboration is expected to inject INR20 billion (US$231.2 million) into the regional economy, potentially creating 100,000 direct and indirect jobs while accelerating the development of the 265-acre India Taiwan Industrial Park.\n\nS.K. Sharma from the Telangana government highlighted the industrial zone's strategic location near manufacturing giants like Foxconn. The freehold land classification ensures long-term security for investors, with provisions for residential and social infrastructure addressing expatriate needs.\n\nBilateral economic relationship strengthens\n\nHo emphasized India's economic potential and the importance of Taiwanese participation in this growth story. The Taiwan Chamber of Commerce is working to strengthen bilateral economic ties by fostering an enabling environment through financial and infrastructural support.\n\nThe initiative marks a significant evolution in Taiwan-India economic relations, offering Taiwanese companies both a hedge against geopolitical uncertainties and access to India's growing market while bringing Taiwan's technological expertise to India's developing industrial landscape.\n\nArticle edited by Charlene Chen"

        "full_text": "The Caribbean hotel market has long been one of the most enviable and robust sectors in the global hospitality industry. Thanks to its convenient proximity to the United States, the Caribbean offers an unbeatable combination of weather, sun, and adventure, attracting millions of visitors annually and fueling tourism-dependent economies. Following the 2020-2021 downturn in the travel industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the market continues to improve and flourish, albeit at a slower pace in the last 12 months compared with prior years. This recovery is further supported by strategic investments in infrastructure, enhanced tourism offerings, and targeted marketing campaigns aimed at attracting diverse traveler segments.\n\nIndustry Snapshot\n\nThe Caribbean hotel market has shown remarkable resilience following the pandemic, with demand rebounding strongly. According to the Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO), the region welcomed more than 28 million visitors in 2023, a substantial increase compared to previous years, reflecting strong pent-up demand for leisure travel. In the first half of 2024, international arrivals to the Caribbean increased by 10% year over year. This was a 13% increase compared to 2019, before the pandemic. This surge highlights not only the enduring appeal of the Caribbean but also the successful efforts of local governments and tourism boards in revitalizing the industry.\n\nHowever, the Caribbean\u2019s growth was more modest than the Americas, which saw a 15% increase over the same period. Major destinations such as the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Puerto Rico have reported near or above pre-pandemic occupancy rates. Luxury and all-inclusive segments continue to perform exceptionally well, driven by increased consumer preference for high-end, experience-based stays. Additionally, the introduction of new flight routes and improved air connectivity has played a pivotal role in facilitating this growth.\n\nCaribbean Hotel Performance, Year to Date October (Data Source: STRCoStar)\u2014 Source: Integra Realty Resources, Inc.\n\n2024 Market Performance\n\nAs of the latest available data in 2024, the Caribbean hotel market has demonstrated notable performance metrics:\n\nOccupancy Rates: For the 12-month period through October 2024, the average hotel occupancy in the Caribbean stood at 66.21%, reflecting a 1.47% increase over the prior twelve months.\n\nAverage Daily Rate (ADR): For the same period, the ADR reached $326.65, marking a 3.46% rise over the previous year.\n\nRevenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): RevPAR increased by 3.21% to $225.82, year-over-year.\n\nAlthough growth remained positive in all three metrics through October 2024, the pace has slowed compared to the sharp increases seen in the immediate post-COVID years of 2022 and 2023. However, these continued improvements highlight a strong rebound and sustained demand for Caribbean hospitality offerings. Growth has been fueled by higher luxury travel demand, improved tourism infrastructure, and continued digital transformation across the industry. Furthermore, the rise in remote work and flexible travel arrangements has encouraged longer stays, contributing positively to hotel revenues.\n\nIn 2024, the Caribbean experienced a significant increase in international air arrivals, surpassing 2019 levels by 13% in the first half of the year. This surge in air travel directly contributed to the improved hotel performance metrics observed during the same period. The heightened influx of tourists led to higher occupancy rates, which, in turn, enabled hotels to implement strategic pricing adjustments, resulting in increased Average Daily Rates (ADR) and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR). The strong correlation between rising air arrivals and enhanced hotel performance underscores the critical role of accessible and increased air travel in driving the Caribbean\u2019s tourism and hospitality sectors. Notably, partnerships between airlines and local tourism boards have facilitated the expansion of direct flight options, making the region more accessible than ever before.\n\nHotel Statistics by Country, 12 Months Ending October 2024 (Data Source: STRCoStar)\u2014 Source: Integra Realty Resources, Inc.\n\nIsland-Specific Performance\n\nThe ultra-luxe destinations with a predominance of luxury villas and condo-hotel units show the highest ADRs based on STR/CoStar data (T-12 through Oct. 2024). These include St. Barth at $2,518, Anguilla at $1,623.68, and Turks & Caicos at $1,168.59. These three markets are truly outliers, with all the other top Caribbean markets having T-12 ADRs ranging from $208 (Dominican Republic) to $895 (Antigua & Barbuda). Other standouts include the Cayman Islands ($681) and the USVI ($434). The popularity of these destinations is often linked to their exclusive offerings, pristine natural environments, and premium hospitality services tailored to affluent travelers.\n\nIn terms of growth or improvement in ADR, the Dominican Republic tops the list at 14.6% year-over-year, followed by Curacao at 11.8% and Barbados at 9.4%. The islands with the most growth in occupancy include the USVI (+13.8%) and St. Lucia (+7.0%). It should be noted that some of the islands with significantly improved rates paid in the form of lower occupancy, such as the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas. This dynamic highlights the delicate balance between pricing strategies and occupancy rates, where premium pricing can sometimes lead to reduced volume but higher overall revenue.\n\nIn terms of overseas arrivals, Puerto Rico increased by 18% year-on-year in the first half of 2024. This was largely due to an increase in arrivals from the United States. Next door, in the USVI, arrivals to St. Thomas and St. Croix increased 16.5% during the same period. These increases reflect both strong marketing efforts targeting U.S. travelers and improved flight connectivity, enhancing the islands\u2019 appeal as convenient getaway destinations.\n\nEmerging Trends Driving Growth\n\nResurgence of Luxury and All-Inclusive Resorts: The demand for luxury accommodations and all-inclusive experiences has surged. Travelers seek seamless, high-quality stays that offer safety, exclusivity, and personalized services. Brands such as Sandals Resorts, Marriott, and Hilton have expanded their all-inclusive portfolios in response to this demand, especially in the luxury sector. This trend is further supported by travelers\u2019 growing desire for curated experiences that combine relaxation with cultural immersion.\n\nSustainability and Eco-Friendly Developments: Implementing sustainability programs has become a major factor influencing hotel investments in the Caribbean. Properties are integrating renewable energy sources, water conservation techniques, and waste reduction strategies. These programs not only broaden the market of tourists but can also improve the bottom line since energy costs in the Caribbean are some of the highest in the world. Travelers are increasingly prioritizing eco-friendly accommodations, making sustainability a competitive advantage for hospitality providers.\n\nThe Rise of Boutique and Lifestyle Hotels: While large-scale resorts dominate the market, there is a growing niche for boutique and lifestyle hotels that offer unique, culturally immersive experiences. These properties appeal to travelers seeking personalized service, locally inspired designs, and community-driven initiatives. Such hotels often serve as cultural ambassadors, offering guests authentic experiences that reflect the local heritage and traditions.\n\nTechnology Integration and Digital Innovation: The adoption of AI-driven booking platforms, contactless check-ins, and bright room technology is becoming more prevalent across the region. Innovations like virtual concierge services and smart room features are enhancing the guest experience, streamlining operations, and meeting the evolving expectations of tech-savvy travelers.\n\nGrowth in ADR and Occupancy by Country 2024 (Data Source: STRCoStar)\u2014 Source: Integra Realty Resources, Inc.\n\nOngoing Market Challenges\n\nDespite the positive momentum, several challenges persist:\n\nClimate Change and Natural Disasters: The Caribbean remains highly vulnerable to hurricanes and rising sea levels. Hotels must invest in resilient infrastructure and disaster preparedness strategies to mitigate these risks. Proactive measures, such as sustainable building practices and robust emergency response plans, are essential to safeguard both assets and guests.\n\nHigh Operating Costs: Energy costs, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions contribute to the region\u2019s high operational expenses. Hoteliers are increasingly seeking cost-effective solutions, such as renewable energy and automation. Additionally, strategic sourcing and local partnerships can help mitigate some of these cost pressures.\n\nRegulatory and Taxation Hurdles: Each Caribbean country has its own investment regulations, tax policies, and labor laws, which can complicate expansion efforts for international hotel brands. Navigating these regulatory landscapes requires strategic planning and local partnerships. Collaborating with local stakeholders can also foster community support and streamline operational processes.\n\nWorkforce Challenges: The hospitality sector faces talent shortages due to cost-of-living challenges, migration, and seasonal employment patterns. Many properties invest in training programs and competitive incentives to retain skilled workers. Developing robust employee engagement strategies and offering career advancement opportunities can improve retention and attract top talent.\n\nInvestment and Development Opportunities\n\nThe Caribbean remains an attractive market for hotel investments, with numerous development opportunities:\n\nFrom the continually growing hospitality offerings in the Dominican Republic to smaller destinations known for safety and luxury, such as the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands, emerging market destinations such as Grenada, St. Vincent, and the Grenadines offer pristine landscapes, government incentives, and a growing tourism infrastructure.\n\nResort Renovations and Upgrades: Many older properties are undergoing renovations to meet evolving consumer expectations. Investors are modernizing design aesthetics, integrating technology, and enhancing sustainability features to remain competitive. Renovations often focus on upgrading guest rooms, enhancing wellness facilities, and incorporating eco-friendly materials.\n\nLuxury and Wellness-Oriented Resorts: The wellness tourism market is booming, and the Caribbean is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Spa retreats, holistic wellness centers, and health-focused resorts are in high demand, attracting health-conscious travelers. Incorporating wellness offerings, such as yoga retreats, spa therapies, and organic dining options, can significantly enhance a property\u2019s appeal.\n\nVacation Rentals and Alternative Accommodations: Besides the rapid increase in private homes offered as accommodations in the Sharing Economy, investors are exploring opportunities to develop villa communities and branded residences catering to affluent travelers who prefer private, home-like settings. These properties often provide high levels of privacy, exclusive amenities, and personalized services, making them highly desirable for luxury travelers.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nThe Caribbean hotel market continues to recover strongly, with robust demand drivers supporting future growth. While economic uncertainties and climate risks pose challenges, the region\u2019s natural beauty, strategic location, and ongoing infrastructure investments position it as a premier global tourism hotspot. The market is also experiencing a dynamic transformation driven by changing traveler preferences, sustainability initiatives, and technological advancements. Despite high costs and climate vulnerabilities, the region presents numerous opportunities for investors, hoteliers, and developers.\n\nHoteliers and investors who prioritize sustainability, digital transformation, and experiential offerings will be best placed to thrive in this evolving market. As tourism continues to rebound, the Caribbean remains a compelling and resilient investment destination, poised for sustained growth and long-term success through innovation and responsible tourism practices. With continued investment in infrastructure, workforce development, and sustainable practices, the Caribbean hospitality sector is well-positioned to maintain its momentum and adapt to future challenges.\n\nReprinted from the Hotel Business Review with permission from www.HotelExecutive.com."

        "full_text": "Simple outdoor projects can significantly increase your home value, especially if you plan to sell it. Visitors will notice the front lawn leading to the door before checking the backyard or interior makeup. While you may consider the outdoor space a separate section of your home, improving it can significantly influence buyer\u2019s perceptions of your home.\n\nHowever, not all outdoor renovations will deliver the desired results. What you see as an upgrade can negatively affect property resale value. Here are some top outdoor projects likely to increase your home value.\n\nHow Does Landscaping Increase Home Price?\n\nLandscaping refers to any project that increases the visual value of outdoor space. The activities can be divided into biological elements (softscaping) and non-living aspects (hardscaping). Like interior renovations, these activities often aim to expand outdoor living space, enhance visual appeal, or reduce overall maintenance costs. That means any project you invest in revolves around these three goals, whether premium or budget-friendly.\n\nAccording to research, a well-maintained landscape can increase the property\u2019s value by 5.5% to 12.7%. These figures may seem overall, considering the thousands of dollars that go into improving the interior space. However, they translate to a higher price than homes with low-maintained or no landscape. While most homeowners invest in landscaping only for visual goals, it is also recommended to consider ideas that guarantee monetary gains.\n\nLandscaping Projects That Improve a Property\u2019s Value\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive real estate market, not all improvements can increase a home\u2019s price. Some people value simple upgrades that provide more exterior seating and relaxation areas, while others are more inclined to use aesthetic elements. Whether you are into softscaping or hardscaping, here are top renovations that are more likely to increase home value.\n\nPlanting Mature Trees\n\nTrees form a crucial part of any property as they offer natural outdoor shades. However, most buyers value an elaborate design with mature trees planted in the right spots. Studies show that buyers are likely to spend more on a home with larger trees than one without. That is because mature trees improve air quality and reduce water runoff, besides making the house look nice.\n\nThe perceived price increase depends on the type of trees you plant and where you plant them. For instance, planting large trees in a prominent front yard will likely fetch the highest price. On the other hand, planting trees that provide shade or privacy screens on the back patios can command a higher price tag. When selecting trees, starting with native species that require fewer maintenance resources is recommended. Some premium choices include white firs and sugar maples.\n\nXeriscaping\n\nXeriscaping uses drought-friendly features that require little to no irrigation to nourish. It might be among the most expensive projects to indulge in. However, it has recently experienced a significant increase in demand. This is due to more people looking for natural solutions to the current climate changes. For instance, a typical project can cost as high as $20 per square foot. However, when done correctly, it can increase a home\u2019s value by 15%.\n\nSome water-wise xeriscaping ideas include planting low-water plants and investing more in hardscaping using stones and pavers to reduce lawn water requirements. Installing an automated irrigation system also ensures water is used where necessary. Working with an experienced landscaping team is essential for investing in the right xeriscaping projects that add value while reducing water reliance. That is true whether you want landscape construction in Port Dover or any other region.\n\nBuilding Decks and Patios\n\nOutdoor seating spaces are becoming popular sections for relaxation and entertainment. A well-built patio or deck can provide a seamless intersection between interior and exterior areas besides extending your home. This can yield a return on investment of about 80% for wood decks or 59% for composite decks.\n\nWhen building exterior living spaces, focus on elements that increase livability and functionality. You should invest in comfortable outdoor furniture, kitchens, and fireplaces. These features will make the outdoor space more valuable and attractive. When finished with trending colors and outdoor lighting, beautiful patios and decks will make your home more appealing to buyers, commanding a higher price tag.\n\nInstalling Sprinkler Systems and Water Features\n\nHomeseekers want healthy and beautiful lawns without worrying about maintenance costs. Setting up sprinkler systems allows for a uniform water supply across the lawn all the time, reducing the need for hand watering. A well-functioning watering system also shows how much you have invested in maintaining your home. This significantly influences its return on investment, mainly among eco-conscious homebuyers.\n\nWater features enhance the beauty of your home and attract more buyers. Ponds and fountains, for instance, create a calming environment for you and your visitors. However, always consider where you add them, as they can become a security concern for your family. Installing accent lighting around the water feature can increase its visual appeal while ensuring family safety.\n\nCreating Decorative Front Entrances and Walkways\n\nA beautiful front entrance creates a positive mood for the home. The first step to attracting premium buyers is adding a new coat of paint or stain to exterior walls. From there, you can add more greenery and colorful flowers around the front door to enhance visual appeal. Consider using evergreen shrubs and seasonal flowers with minimum maintenance costs.\n\nWalkways and paths also play a significant role in creating an appealing landscape. Well-maintained and defined walkways allow visitors to explore different yard sections, influencing their buying decisions. When constructing walkways and paths, always choose materials that match your home\u2019s style and nearby features. Flagstone pavers and gravel are the most common options with the highest cost recovery.\n\nEndnote\n\nEnhancing your property\u2019s exterior sections can positively impact its market price and visual appeal. Simple projects like planting mature trees and building decks can make your home more attractive. Using drought-friendly features also makes your home sustainable, attracting high-budget and environmentally conscious buyers. However, like any other upgrade, investing in projects that appeal to most buyers is recommended to avoid over-personalizing your home. Staying ahead of the trending ideas is also essential to fit the ever-changing housing market."

        "full_text": "Sankaran Naren, a very renowned figure of Indian financial markets, has been sailing through a number of market cycles as the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company. Investors can pick up a lot from him on the basis of his experience, macroeconomic understanding and stock ideas.\n\nInvestment strategy of Sankaran Naren Sankaran Naren has over two decades of experience at ICICI Prudential AMC and is known for his contrarian investment approach buying undervalued sectors when sentiment is low and exiting during market highs.\n\nAlso Read | 5 investing lessons from Jeremy Grantham on avoiding herd mentality\n\nHis deep understanding of macroeconomic trends and market cycles has helped ICICI Prudential become a leading asset manager in India. Naren\u2019s disciplined, research-backed strategy emphasises consistency and patience, even in volatile markets. The three investment lessons from his career outlined below can be beneficial to Indian investors with sound investment choice:\n\nEmphasis on growth and quality One of the most vital investment thesis of Naren is the quality and growth-oriented strategy. He has been of the view that it is imperative that one should invest in companies having: solid fundamentals, stable finances, strong moat over peers, stable performance track record and a documented record of expansion.\n\nThis approach, if followed, will help the investors to stay clear of speculative trading and rather build a portfolio that will be able to withstand market volatility. Thus, given the competitive advantage of most companies along with their quality, wise investment decisions are feasible only through simple strategies and consistent reading and understanding of key fundamentals of companies.\n\nDiversification is the key Naren has also emphasised the importance of intelligent diversification of investment portfolios in his other interactions, so that one accumulates wealth in the long run. By diversifying consistently across industries and asset classes, ignoring taking loans, short term vision, one can minimise risks and gain under both bull and bear markets.\n\nAlso Read | Raamdeo Agarwal\u2019s top 5 principles for successful investing\n\nHence, it will be wise on the part of investors to have a balanced portfolio with a mix of growth and value stocks along with debt investments to manage risk effectively.\n\nLong term vision One of the most important lessons that can be drawn from Naren's investment experience is long-term thinking. He has always been guided by the philosophy of taking investment decisions keeping in mind a long-term objective and trusting the process of compounding.\n\nTherefore, investors do not need to take decisions with a short-term mindset of market fluctuation and greed. Mindset of long term vision and simplicity can assist in comprehensive compounding of the portfolio much similar to the ideals of investing legengs such as Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.\n\nFinally, Naren has also commented on the necessity of overhauling investment behavior under altered conditions in the stock market. It's a matter of remembering and always keeping in mind the economic trends, regulatory changes, and consumer trends, each of which can be important to shape investment decisions.\n\nBy being current and adaptable, investors can rebalance investments so that maximum return is achieved at the lowest risk. Continuous reading, selecting good mutual funds, staying current regarding macroeconomic and geopolitical trends, and taking a position based on it constitute the structured strategy."

        "full_text": "Society / Cultural Contradictions / When They Came for Columbia University The university has become the Trump administration\u2019s test case for the largest assault on higher education since the McCarthy era. Sadly, it has notably failed to defend itself.\n\nStill on lockdown: The gates of Columbia University, which have remained padlocked since the beginning of pro-Palestinian protests last April. (Alex Kent / Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s abduction, detainment, and threatened deportation of the Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil earlier this month is first and foremost a threat to every American\u2019s civil liberties. Khalil\u2014a green card\u2013carrying legal resident of the United States, whose wife is a US citizen and eight months pregnant\u2014has not been charged with or even accused of any crime. By the implicit admission of President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Khalil was arrested by Department of Homeland Security officials in New York and transported to an ICE detention center in Louisiana entirely on the basis of his constitutionally protected speech criticizing US support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. To Trump and his enablers in, for instance, the Anti-Defamation League, Khalil\u2019s nonviolent activism constitutes material support for terrorism and therefore justifies the suspension of his rights. Trump has promised many more arrests of pro-Palestine activists\u2014indeed, more have already begun\u2014and the precedent he is establishing with Khalil is one that could easily be used to penalize any kind of speech the administration disapproves of. As not nearly enough elected Democrats have said, one need not agree with any of Khalil\u2019s positions to defend his rights both to express them and to remain in the country.\n\nWhat is happening to Khalil has been enabled at every turn by one of the most venerated elite liberal institutions in the country, Columbia University, which has consistently failed to defend basic academic freedom since the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023. For decades, Columbia has been a symbolic battleground between critics and defenders of the State of Israel. As the one Ivy League school located in the global media capital, home to both a large Jewish population and a tradition of radical activism dating back to the near-legendary 1968 student revolt\u2014and as the school where Edward Said taught for years and where Bari Weiss staged her first provocations\u2014Columbia commands outsize attention. It hosted arguably the most infamous pro-Palestinian encampments of any major university last spring, which were met by the most infamous police crackdown. Now, with Khalil\u2019s arrest, Columbia has become the Trump administration\u2019s test case for the largest assault on American higher education since the McCarthy era.\n\nWhen Donald Trump first assumed the presidency eight years ago, Columbia, like many universities, positioned itself as part of the broad resistance movement defending core liberal principles. Barely a week into Trump\u2019s first term, Columbia\u2019s then-president Lee Bollinger put out a strong statement condemning the new president\u2019s executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. \u201c[T]he University, as an institution in the society, must step forward to object when policies and state action conflict with its fundamental values,\u201d Bollinger wrote at the time, in a letter pledging solidarity and support to the Muslim and international students and faculty potentially affected by the ban.\n\nBollinger, a leading First Amendment scholar\u2014who in 2007 had invited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak on campus and stood his ground after significant blowback\u2014understood that Columbia had a role to play in protecting the rights of free speech, religious expression, and assembly. While his long tenure was not without controversies, he offered his campus some basic reassurance when those rights came under threat from the Trump administration.\n\nThat commitment was sorely lacking last spring when Bollinger\u2019s freshly installed successor, Nemat Shafik, was thrust into the university\u2019s biggest crisis since 1968. In April, as student activists set up encampments on Columbia\u2019s main campus to demand that the university divest from Israel amid its genocidal war on Gaza, Shafik was called before Congress to testify about what Republicans alleged was the campus\u2019s pervasive climate of antisemitism. Having just seen the presidents of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania ousted over the same set of issues, Shafik\u2014accompanied by still-active members of the Columbia Board of Trustees\u2014turned in a shambolic, evasive performance that failed either to defend academic freedom or to deter Representative Elise Stefanik from calling for Shafik\u2019s resignation shortly thereafter.\n\nThe night after her testimony, Shafik ordered an initial police sweep to shut down the encampments, resulting in over 100 arrests but failing to prevent activists from setting up another encampment the next day. After two weeks of refusing to negotiate in good faith, Shafik called the cops again to expel students occupying an administration building. Starting even before any encampments were set up and continuing to this day, Columbia has been sealed off with 24/7 security checkpoints from the surrounding neighborhood, to the consternation of local residents. Having comprehensively mismanaged every part of this fiasco, Shafik was forced to resign after just a year on the job."

        "full_text": "A federal judge has blocked an Environmental Protection Agency order for the cancelation of some $20 billion in federal funding for energy transition-related projects. Access for the beneficiaries of that funding has also been blocked by the ruling.\n\nThe new head of the EPA, Lee Zeldin, said in February he and his team were going to recover the \u201cgold bars\u201d that one former EPA employee was filmed as saying the agency was \u201cthrowing off the Titanic\u201d, referring to climate finance to the tune of $20 billion that was being distributed post haste to entities involved in the energy transition in the final days of the Bien administration.\n\nSoon enough Zeldin\u2019s team found the money, with the EPA\u2019s chief saying \u201cThis pot of $20 billion dollars was awarded to just eight entities that were then responsible for doling out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency. Some $7 billion of these dollars were sent to an entity called the Climate United Fund.\u201d\n\nPer the ruling of District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the EPA will be barred from accessing the funds deposited with Citibank because it \u201cgave no legal justification for the termination\u201d of the contracts that the Biden administration had signed with the institution, Politico reported.\n\nAt the same time, the three entities that were meant to be beneficiaries of the $20-billion pot\u2014Climate United Fund, the Coalition for Green Capital, and Power Forward Communities\u2014will also have no access to the money. Essentially, the ruling amounts to a freeze that does not prevent the EPA from pursuing its intention to terminate the relevant contracts in the future.\n\nOf the total $20 billion, $ 7 billion was granted to the Climate United Fund, another $2 billion was earmarked for projects by Power Forward Communities, and $5 billion was due to the Coalition for Green Capital. All three say that now they would have to lay off staff and cancel projects because they have no access to the money.\n\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

They highlighted some \"fundamental similarities\" between the current cycle and China's stock market crash in 2015.\n\nBofA strategists said in their Monday note that the current rally in Chinese stocks is similar to the cycle a decade ago in terms of economic rebalancing, policy stimulus and reforms, and technological breakthroughs.\n\nIn 2015, the Chinese government aimed to shift its export- and investment-oriented economy to one driven by consumption and services. Alibaba's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange was also a watershed moment for China tech.\n\nSimilarly, stock markets in Hong Kong and China have posted strong gains in recent weeks following the breakout rise of DeepSeek, a cost-efficient Chinese AI model.

They are also concerned that negative news, including Trump's tariffs and geopolitical tensions, has largely been overlooked.\n\nTo be sure, China's stock markets are not just gaining due to DeepSeek's breakthrough moment. Investors concerned about US President Donald Trump's economic and trade policy changes have also been reallocating some of their funds into other markets, sending global equities rallying too.\n\nHowever, some analysts are wary about calling it a sustainable run because the US economy \u2014 the world's largest, accounting for about a quarter of global GDP \u2014could dive and affect markets far beyond its borders.\n\nAs Dario Perkins, an economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard wrote on Monday, \"make no mistake \u2014 a US recession would bring down the entire world.\""

        "full_text": "Joint UN meeting tackles small arms control to foster sustainable development\n\n17 March 2025 - On Monday, during a meeting of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, UN officials and disarmament experts emphasized the urgent need to tackle the widespread issue of small arms and light weapons. They warned that the stakes are higher than ever in a world increasingly plagued by conflict and crisis.\n\nAt the joint session, speakers before two of the UN's most representative bodies stressed that these weapons have fueled wars, exacerbated humanitarian crises and undermined efforts for peace and stability. The urgency to curb their proliferation, stakeholders noted, has made the search for integrated approaches to disarmament and development ever more critical.\n\nThe session, entitled Small arms and light weapons control for preventing violence and advancing sustainable development, was opened by Philemon Yang, President of the General Assembly.\n\nMayhem and 'the weapon of choice'\n\nHe emphasized that the gathering was not intended to review progress on the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, known by the shorthand 'PoA', but rather to focus on the destructive impact of illicit flows and misuse of small arms and light weapons on development.\n\n\"Our objective today is to focus on the destructive impact of the illicit flows and misuse of small arms and light weapons on development,\" Mr. Yang stated, underscoring the ease with which these arms can be acquired due to their availability and low cost, leading to their misuse by non-state actors and driving instability and conflict worldwide.\n\n\"It is estimated that 580,000 people died violently in 2021, half of them by firearm,\" he noted, adding that small arms are the weapon of choice in nearly half of all homicides globally.\n\nThe Assembly President also highlighted the disproportionate impact on women and girls, with estimates indicating that between 70 and 90 per cent of incidents of sexual violence during conflict involve small arms and light weapons.\n\n\"In conflict and post-conflict situations, such as in Haiti, South Sudan, Sudan, and many parts of the Sahel, illicit small arms and light weapons jeopardize peace and sow the seeds of future instability, creating a vicious cycle of violence and conflict that obstructs sustainable development,\" he explained.\n\nMr. Yang pointed out the economic toll of violence linked to these weapons, which was estimated to have cost the global economy $22.6 billion in 2023. \"Imagine what these resources could do if they were deployed towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),\" he urged.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged the implementation gaps that hinder the containment of the phenomenon. \"We hope that today's discussion will be an opportunity to revitalize the debate on illicit flows and misuse of small arms and light weapons and their effects on socio-economic development,\" he said, calling for collaborative and effective approaches to address the issue.\n\nMr. Yang concluded by urging delegations to focus on the dangers to development caused by small arms-related insecurity and excessive military expenditures.\n\n\"Article 26 of the UN Charter calls for the least diversion of the world's human and economic resources to armaments,\" he reminded the joint session, suggesting viable proposals for operationalizing the relationship between disarmament and development.\n\nFollowing Mr. Yang's address, Bob Rae, President of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), emphasized the importance of addressing small arms and light weapons control within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly target 16.4 of SDG16, which calls for a significant reduction of illicit financial and arms flows.\n\n\"Despite this commitment, conventional weapons, including small arms and light weapons, continue to fuel conflicts and inflict a significant number of casualties and suffering every year,\" Mr. Rae stated.\n\nComprehensive approaches can save lives\n\nMr. Rae called for a comprehensive and integrated response to address the adverse consequences of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons on sustainable development.\n\n\"Addressing the issue of small arms and light weapons comprehensively will not only save lives directly, but also indirectly by channeling resources towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals as well as other basic needs of populations, such as health, education, and housing,\" he explained.\n\nHe emphasized the need for efforts to be guided by the principle of leaving no one behind and aligning the priority of gender equality with the goal of reducing arms.\n\nMr. Rae highlighted the importance of consultations with civil society, indigenous peoples, youth, and members of the LGBTQI+ community to ensure a gender-responsive, inclusive, and intersectional approach to disarmament, non-proliferation, and arms control.\n\nTo effectively mainstream gender in the comprehensive response to small arms and light weapons, he outlined several key actions, including improving data collection on violent crime disaggregated by sex, age, and whether a small arm was used; and promoting the full, equal, meaningful, safe, and effective participation of women in technical and policy-related roles.\n\n\"It is of utmost importance that women are fully represented as active participants, and not just victims, in combating the effects of small arms and light weapons and bringing their voices to strengthen decision-making processes,\" Mr. Rae emphasized.\n\nWomen's voices can strengthen action\n\nHe highlighted the need for an integrated response to address the illicit trade and diversion of small arms and light weapons, harnessing synergies with the SDGs and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).\n\n\"We must engage a wide variety of national institutions, civil society, academia, and research institutions to address the issue of small arms and light weapons efficiently, impactfully, and comprehensively,\" he stated.\n\nThe joint meeting also featured concluding remarks from Adedeji Ebo, Director and Deputy to the UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, who highlighted the gathering's significance in operationalizing commitments from global frameworks, including the small arms and light weapons PoA and the Global Framework for Through-life Conventional Ammunition Management.\n\n\"Today's discussions clearly underscored why strengthening this link is a priority,\" Mr. Ebo stated. He emphasized that small arms and light weapons control is not merely a short-term remedy for public security concerns but a long-term investment in social, political, and economic development.\n\n\"Achieving progress on Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - namely to reduce illicit arms flows - enables us to make progress on several other Goals, including gender equality, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability,\" he explained.\n\nMr. Ebo also outlined several key recommendations from the event, including the need to:\n\nbridge the gap between policy communities at the UN; integrate small arms and light weapons control measures into national and regional development frameworks; and facilitate cross-border collaboration through regional approaches.\n\n\"By embedding small arms control in development strategies, we can better address both immediate and long-term peacebuilding priorities, ensuring a more cohesive approach that links disarmament, development, and human security,\" he stated.\n\nHe also emphasized the importance of a whole-of-government and human-centered approach at the national level, involving cross-disciplinary working groups and broad partnerships with grassroots organizations and civil society.\n\nThe UN official highlighted initiatives such as the ODA-managed UNSCAR Trust Facility and the Saving Lives Entity (SALIENT), which support small arms control and sustainable development efforts.\n\nMr. Ebo echoed other officials in stressing the need for gender-responsive small arms and light weapons policies, including the integration of disarmament efforts into strategies to prevent gender-based violence and empower women as key actors in arms control processes.\n\n\"It is essential that diverse voices and needs are heard in both disarmament and development discussions,\" he stated, calling for inclusive data collection systems and enhanced diversity and inclusion in policymaking processes.\n\nMr. Ebo concluded by highlighting the rising global costs of conflict and military expenditures, as spotlighted in the Pact for the Future, adopted by UN Member States this past September and which lays out a vision for multilateral cooperation across key global issues, including peace and security, the SDGs, development finance, governance reform, and climate change, among others.\n\nHe encouraged ECOSOC and the General Assembly to consider convening a dedicated joint meeting to discuss the findings of a study on this issue. \"The link between disarmament and sustainable development is undeniable.\"\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "full_text": "Plenary session of RSPP Congress\n\nVladimir Putin took part in the annual congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.\n\nMarch 18, 2025\n\n17:05\n\nMoscow\n\nThe agenda includes key aspects of collaboration between businesses and the state, as well as the business community's initiatives aimed at achieving national development goals and implementing national projects.\n\nThe congress brings together about 1,300 participants, including leading entrepreneurs, representatives of small and medium-sized businesses from across the country, heads of ministries and agencies, and key political figures for Russia's economy.\n\n* * *\n\nPresident of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Alexander Shokhin: Mr President,\n\nThank you for finding time in your busy schedule to talk with the delegates and guests of the 34th annual congress of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.\n\nWe know that today you have a very important telephone conversation to make, on which a lot depends not only with regard to developing Russian-American relations, but also settling the conflict in Ukraine and resolving many other geopolitical issues.\n\nBefore you came, we discussed a fairly wide range of issues, above all how to walk the thin line between the controlled contraction of the Russian economy in order to suppress inflation and preventing the overcooling of the Russian economy. In this regard, many of my colleagues spoke about the criteria for selecting investment projects that cannot be abandoned.\n\nThese are projects that are at an advanced stage of implementation, or aimed at national projects, including national technological leadership projects, or those where there is a maximum multiplier and for every invested ruble you can get a 5.7 ruble return.\n\nWe would like these additional criteria formulated right now to be used in our dialogue with the Government, and there will be no need to handpickg projects. Though thanks in part to our meetings with you we have created or renewed platforms, such as the sub-commission of the Government Commission on the Stability of the Russian Economy that resumed work in January, and the situation in certain industries is discussed there several times a month jointly with businesses. We have also established a working group with the Central Bank, where we discuss situations in industries and individual borrowers in order to prevent chains of non-payments and pre-bankruptcy conditions among other things. That is, the work is underway, although we understand that much depends not only on specific decisions, but also on systemic measures.\n\nPersonnel shortage is the second big issue. Many of my colleagues, both from the Government and businesses, spoke about this. On the one hand, we can see that there are possibilities for an expansion of the worktime fund by lifting a number of restrictions on part-time work at the main place of employment and by streamlining migration flows. In particular, it would probably be right to place additional emphasis on the rotational method of recruiting migrants from non-visa-free countries through the mechanism of organised recruitment. We know that the Government is drafting a corresponding law, and we are ready to add companies' experience to the process.\n\nBut obviously the key is still labour productivity growth, including such well-known methods as lean production, and such ways as production automation and robotics. Apparently, we cannot do without investments here. And here we also need to find a way to keep this topic in focus, even with limited budgetary resources, especially since we have additional requirements of technological leadership as well.\n\nAn important topic that we have discussed in the context of personnel policy is the system of vocational education, both secondary vocational education and higher vocational education. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Russian industrial partners are involved in such projects as Professionalitet and Advanced Engineering Schools.\n\nWe believe that such projects shall be expanded. The Government supports this idea. However, it is equally necessary to expand them, not just to engage new colleges or universities, but, in particular, to direct the same Professionalitet project to retraining adult population as well. This is especially important for retraining, occupational retraining and upskilling of the special military operation veterans, who are returning and who need some kind of career prospects, given that they are already, so to speak, people with a rightful claim to more than what they had before joining the special military operation.\n\nThe topics that we discussed also include those that we raised at the previous congress, and during our meetings with you last December in particular, and at the last year's congress, both in a public format and in the format of a meeting with the RUIE bureau members. I would like to remind you of some of the topics that have remained in the works, as it is called.\n\nIn particular, we mean our social partnership expansion. The Constitution has got the concept of social partnership as a major principle. A year ago we raised the issue of mandatory membership of leading companies, socially and economically significant organisations in one of the employers' associations, be it regional, sectoral, inter-sectoral, all-Russian, and so on, and you supported this idea. And also, setting up such an interconnected system of employers' associations.\n\nA year has passed since that congress. To be honest, we have not made much progress so far, although we have prepared the relevant draft laws. And it turns out that major companies say that this is a big burden for them, including paying fees to organisations. Frankly speaking, it might possible to somehow help them.\n\nThe second issue concerns the procedure for Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), which does not apply to tax and fiscal legislative initiatives. When the RIA mechanism was introduced 15 years ago, we consistently advocated from the outset that fiscal amendments should undergo this assessment. However, the Ministry of Finance has always maintained that businesses oppose any tax amendments unless they are explicitly in their favour.\n\nNevertheless, a year ago, we found a balance of interests and reached compromises. The modifications to the tax system that came into force on January 1 this year demonstrate that businesses have not exactly welcomed but approached these changes with understanding. Moreover, they stand ready to refine certain aspects to enhance effectiveness.\n\nWe therefore believe it would be appropriate to continue moving in this direction. Even the public platforms that the State Duma is prepared to provide - such as expert forums or parliamentary hearings - could be utilised. Frequently, draft documents marked \"Not For Public Use\" are issued during preparatory stages, leaving insufficient time for substantive discussion prior to adoption. While the Legislative Commission exists - with many of my colleagues represented at deputy head level - I personally participate to ensure no opportunity is missed to articulate the business community's position.\n\nA critical matter - apologies, Mr President, I realise I may have overextended on this topic - is the protection of bona fide property acquirers' rights, including within privatisation transactions.\n\nYou have emphasised that purchasers should not bear liability for errors committed by federal or regional authorities. Having thoroughly analysed multiple aspects of revising privatisation outcomes, we believe procedural norms could feasibly be established to systematise this process. Specifically, we propose applying statutes of limitation and preclusive time bars under the Civil Code. Privatisation transactions are commercial in nature, and the Civil Code should govern them accordingly. Furthermore, it cannot be asserted that errors committed during privatisation constitute a violation of intangible rights of citizens, in respect of which, as is commonly known, no statute of limitations exists or may apply.\n\nI believe this issue can be resolved, particularly given the active involvement of the Presidential Council for Codificationand Enhancement of Civil Legislation.\n\nI am confident that today's congress outcomes and the forthcoming open discussion will advance these matters.\n\nOne final request, Mr President. Given the numerous statements today from both business and government representatives: If we formalise these proposals - including those stemming from the 19 forums of the Russian Business Week held in February - and ask you to instruct the Government to review them jointly with us, this would significantly facilitate resolving all outstanding issues within a year. We would greatly appreciate this.\n\nThank you.\n\nPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Shokhin, friends, colleagues,\n\nMr Shokhin has mentioned my schedule. Indeed, the Russian Constitution grants broad presidential powers. However, I would like to emphasise that your work remains critically important regardless of constitutional authority, because you represent vast workforces and bear responsibility for the social and economic well-being of millions of workers.\n\nThere are always many pressing issues. Mr Shokhin has just spoken about protecting the interests of bona fide purchasers and matters related to privatisation. We have discussed this extensively, and rightly so. These discussions must continue until a final resolution is reached. At the same time, Mr Shokhin noted that not all major businesses and corporations are eager to join the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and suggested that perhaps they need some encouragement. Even within your community, philosophical contradictions - as scholars might say - sometimes emerge. But we will continue our work, engage in discussions, and, I hope, find solutions.\n\nI am delighted to welcome all participants of the plenary session, which brings together leading Russian companies - true market leaders, including those on a global scale.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to thank the members of the RSPP for their commitment to the national development agenda and their active role in shaping measures that strengthen our economy and sovereignty. Their efforts contribute to making Russia's investment and business climate more favourable and aligned with entrepreneurs' needs. This work helps Russian enterprises and their employees to gain a clear understanding of long-term prospects, develop growth strategies and make informed decisions that benefit both individual companies and entire industries.\n\nHopefully, I will be able to answer some questions outlined by Mr Shokhin. If not, we will have a meeting with the RUIE Bureau. We will have an opportunity to discuss certain issues behind closed doors, as they say, and in an absolutely frank manner.\n\nIn fact, there are many challenges in this regard, including the need to upgrade the real sector's legislative framework, remove excessive barriers, and generally improve the regulatory environment for businesses. In a word, we are talking about a complex, multifaceted cooperation that, regrettably, is not without hitches. Regretfully, some papers get stuck somewhere, there are protracted coordination procedures (as has been mentioned right now), or problems and uncertainties arise, which could not be envisaged, problems that impede the common effort.\n\nIt is quite right that you directly outline these problem areas. I am confident that your colleagues from the Government will cooperate with you in promptly addressing these issues and will interact with you in the interests of the state and the entrepreneurial community. Let me note that the Russian business community has faced significant challenges over the recent years. We are well aware of this. These include a powerful sanctions pressure, primarily restrictions on international settlements and transactions on external markets. As a whole, these and other challenges are undermining the freedom of trade and investment in the world economy. I will also say a few words about this as an aside.\n\nImportantly, Russian entrepreneurs have learned to work under sanctions during this period. They have adapted to sanctions, inventing and launching alternative mechanisms for cooperation with foreign partners - those who want to work with us. Besides, sanctions have become an additional catalyst of sorts to positive structural changes in the Russian economy, including in finance and technology, and in many other key spheres.\n\nI know that the business and expert communities are actively discussing the future of the illegitimate sanctions against Russia, Russian companies and citizens: whether they will be lifted, remain in force, intensify, etc. Friends and colleagues, I suggest that we proceed from the following considerations.\n\nIndeed, these considerations lie on the surface.\n\nSanctions are neither temporary nor targeted measures; they constitute a mechanism of systemic, strategic pressure against our nation. Regardless of global developments or shifts in the international order, our competitors will perpetually seek to constrain Russia and diminish its economic and technological capacities.\n\nMoreover, whereas the so-called Western elites previously attempted to cloak this confrontation in propriety, they now evidently seem to no longer feel the need to be concerned about appearances, nor do they intend to be. They not only routinely threaten Russia with new sanctions but churn out these packages incessantly. One gains the impression that even the architects themselves have lost track of the restrictions imposed and their targets.\n\nHere, the Ministry of Finance has tallied them. I state with confidence: 28,595 sanctions against individuals and legal entities. This exceeds - by a significant margin - all sanctions ever imposed on all other nations combined.\n\nEven if there is some gesture from their side - say, they propose to lift or ease something - we can expect that another way will be found to exert pressure, to throw a spanner in the works, as was the case with the well-known Jackson-Vanik amendment. The Soviet Union, against which it was originally introduced, no longer existed, and relations between Russia and the United States of America were at their absolute best, as good as they could possibly be. Yet the amendment continued to remain in force. And when it was seemingly repealed, it was in fact simply replaced with another restrictive instrument against Russia. Recall this: repealed, then supplanted.\n\nI reiterate: sanctions and restrictions are the reality of the existing new stage of development that the entire world, the entire global economy, has entered. The global competitive struggle has intensified, assuming increasingly sophisticated and uncompromising forms.\n\nThus, literally before our eyes, a new spiral of economic rivalry is unfolding, and under these conditions, it is almost embarrassing to recall the norms and rules of the World Trade Organisation, once zealously promoted by the West. Once... When? When these rules advantaged them... As soon as they became disadvantageous, everything began to change. And all these negotiations stalled. And, in fact, no one needs them anymore.\n\nThis is evident, and I have emphasised it repeatedly: a return to pre-existing conditions is impossible. We should not anticipate fully unfettered trade, payments, or capital flows, nor rely on Western mechanisms to safeguard investor and entrepreneur rights. Yes, Alexander Shokhin referenced this, and I opened with it: we have our own systemic problems related to privatisation, to the protection of the rights of bona fide acquirers. My stance is known. Some matters are still stalled, but jointly, we will ensure that this issue is finally resolved.\n\nWhat do I want to say? Our challenges exist, but theirs are also abundant. We must acknowledge that even in the past, these mechanisms faltered. I am referring to those proposed by our so-called Western partners. And now the fa\u00e7ade, as they say, has collapsed: it has become clear to everyone what the various high courts in European capitals are worth, the Western jurisdictions that many sought out to hide themselves and quietly conceal something. That's it. None of that exists anymore. And there are no opaque jurisdictions left.\n\nIn these conditions, it is important for Russian businesses to show flexibility, explore new markets, design their own technological solutions, and establish cooperation with reliable partners, there are many of them in the world. Of course, the Government and the regions must provide, and are providing, the required support here. For my part, I will do everything possible to support this process.\n\nRussia is strengthening its sovereignty in all areas that would ensure the operation of businesses, such as the development of transport, logistics, and financial and payment infrastructure. We are already doing this and will definitely keep dong it.\n\nI know and understand the challenges you are facing, but we will do everything to help you. Let me stress: only those countries that can ensure real, full sovereignty become stable in general and resistant to external pressure, and can progress dynamically in the interests of their people.\n\nLet me give you a clear example. In fact, it is well known, but I will nevertheless use the occasion to say it again. We can see that most European countries have lost their sovereignty, and as a result they have faced serious problems both in the economy and in the security sphere. As for the economy, all of them have near-zero growth rates or are even entering a recession. On the contrary, the BRICS countries and those that wish to join the association understand the benefit of combining potentials, and in recent years they have been leaders in global growth, creating a high benchmark for economic dynamics.\n\nLet me remind you that the GDP growth of the Eurozone was 0.9 percent in 2024, I mean of the \"Big Seven\" (Why is it big? It is not clear. What is big about it? Wherever you look, you can't find any of them on the map.) that has the growth of 1.9 percent, while the BRICS has 4.9. In Russia, it was 4.1 for two years in a row - last year and the year before. (Applause.) I know, and I'll talk about this now, of course. By the way, you applauded to yourselves; these are your results, thank you. I will applaud you. (Applause.)\n\nWe were just talking - Mr Shokhin did - about the cooling of the economy. Of course, we need to proceed with a great deal of caution in this regard. Clearly, this is unavoidable, and the Government and the Central Bank mentioned it, too. It seems a general agreement has been reached. We need to make sure that things in practice turn out as planned, and we do not let things cool down too much like in a cryotherapy chamber. Things should go smoothly and slowly. I am not going to now, the figures are known. The Central Bank has its own figures, and the Government and the Ministry of Economic Development have their own. It is not 4.1 percent, but 2 to 2.5 percent. But we need to make sure things do not collapse or freeze too much. It's a fine line to walk, but I hope we will cope with it.\n\nWe can get back to it later. However, I suggest that we do not start a discussion right now, because if we do we will be talking through the night, I know that.\n\nYesterday - or was it already today - Mr Oreshkin and I sat until 2 am. Or, rather 3 am. So, we really talked until the morning. I hope we will eventually go down that path, tread lightly, and get the result we need.\n\nThe so-called Western dominance slipping away, and new global growth centres taking the centre stage is a long-term trend, and I want to emphasise that. Yes, of course, we are fully aware of the advantages offered by our so-called Western partners, such as advanced technology and production process organisation. They have that, it is true. They have achieved a lot. We should respect that and use their best practices, but not copy them.\n\nWe should keep in mind that growth rates in various regions of the world will remain stable over the next several decades. And the fact that we have, to a certain extent, refocused our priorities (not through our fault, by the way) due to a number of circumstances may be a good thing. We are shifting our focus to global promising markets. All things that we need we will get one way or another.\n\nOf course, this long-term trend will remain unchanged. It will be bolstered up by, among other things, the BRICS development platform that is currently taking shape. It will include resource, technology, personnel, finance, trade and investment components at a whole new level with the use of cutting-edge digital solutions, which will maximise the platform's effectiveness and keep negative outside interference at bay.\n\nI very much count on Russian businesses taking an active part in these joint projects with our BRICS partners and future BRICS members.\n\nColleagues, I will address another crucial issue that concerns domestic businesses and pertains to Russia's relations with overseas states. Let me reiterate: this concerns the return - the possible return - of foreign companies that exited our market in 2022 and thereafter.\n\nI have previously noted that Russian businesses skilfully capitalised on this opportunity, occupied vacated market niches, invested funds, created jobs, and dedicated considerable time and effort to developing technologies.\n\nNow, certain departed companies are indeed contemplating a return - we are aware of this, though I will refrain from elaborating further to avoid interference. However, our enterprises that have assumed their positions are at various stages of the investment cycle. Some have already made capital investments and established production, while others are only commencing projects and initiating construction despite the high interest rate. Naturally, we have no right to undermine these plans or nullify the efforts and funds invested.\n\nThe interests of Russian companies, enterprises, and their employees will always remain a priority. It is from this standpoint that we will approach the question of overseas businesses returning to our market.\n\nI would emphasise that among foreign companies which left Russia under political pressure from the so-called elites of their countries, some have retained personnel and technologies while transferring management to Russian executives. Effectively, they continued operating in our market under a different brand. We recognise that such investors took significant risks, potentially incurring negative repercussions from their governments, yet they made an independent and responsible choice - a choice we unequivocally respect and will continue to honour in our dealings with such partners.\n\nHowever, there were other companies that made a demonstrative exit, opting to sell their Russian operations - often at a steep discount - and proceeded accordingly. Worse still, some began sabotaging operations, thereby jeopardising entire teams, their Russian clients, suppliers, and contractors. Incidentally, these companies are well-known to us, and we were compelled to introduce interim administration in their case.\n\nI acknowledge that some Western owners were intimidated and lacked the resolve to oppose their political authorities - this explains their conduct. Yet, anticipating a shift in the political winds, they preserved a loophole: retaining buyback rights through prearranged options.\n\nI instruct the Government to closely monitor this situation and similar transactions to prevent scenarios where owners sold their Russian businesses at knockdown prices - effectively abandoning them - only to now seek repurchasing these assets at equally trivial sums. This cannot be permitted; such practices are untenable.\n\nMarket conditions have shifted: companies have strengthened, increased their capitalisation, and now command entirely different valuations. Consequently, each such transaction will evidently require individual, thorough consideration.\n\nTo reiterate, we did not ask anyone to leave. Those who left our market chose to do so themselves under pressure from the elites of their respective countries, or without such pressure, it does not really matter. In any case, we are talking about seasoned businessmen who analysed risks and were clear about the consequences. If the Western companies' niches have now been taken by Russian business, then, as I said before - and we have a popular saying to that effect - this train has left the station, and there will be no privileges or preferences for the returning companies.\n\nAt the same time, Russia remains an open country. Whoever wants to return are welcome to do so on a competitive basis in accordance with our law. I am asking the Government to update the list of foreign companies that have stopped working in Russia, and to develop a procedure for coordinating their return with mandatory guarantees of good faith and conscientious business practices in our country. Of course, this process must be as transparent as it gets.\n\nColleagues, Russia is carrying out large-scale and long-term development plans, launching major infrastructure, industrial and transport projects, developing vast unparalleled territories in the Far East, Siberia, the Arctic, and other regions of our country, and strengthening promising and mutually beneficial ties with the vast majority of countries around the world.\n\nTransitioning to a sustainable trajectory of balanced growth is the main challenge for the national economy. I want to emphasise the balanced growth trajectory. We will need to ensure high-quality and intensive dynamics in the real sector by upgrading production facilities and increasing productivity (better yet, it should be done through the use of innovative technologies rather than intensive approaches), and to increase the output of goods and services across the broadest possible range, thus forming a supply-side economy.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to avoid unbalancing of individual industries and skewing key macro parameters. This is our most important objective. Among other things, we must contain inflation and bring unemployment down. This is a common task facing both the Government and businesses. Not just major businesses that are part of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, but small and medium-sized businesses as well.\n\nBased on the entrepreneurs' demands, we will continue to align the mechanisms of the entire state economic policy, including monetary policy, to make sure that these mechanisms work primarily to increase Russia's production potential, to put new enterprises into operation, and to strengthen the country's technological and financial sovereignty and its human resources potential.\n\nThe Government is currently preparing a corresponding plan that includes additional measures. I count on active participation of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, as well as other business associations in our country, in this work. And of course, I wish everyone success for the benefit of Russia.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlexander Shokhin: Mr President, thank you very much for your substantive address on key issues that concern both business and government.\n\nIndeed, you concluded by saying: \"for the benefit of Russia.\" As evident, our slogan here reads: RSPP: Uniting Business for the Benefit of Russia.\n\nVladimir Putin: I read it.\n\nAlexander Shokhin: Thank you. Then our efforts were not in vain.\n\nMr President, I would like to inform you that two years ago from this rostrum, you instructed the RUIE to establish the Leaders of Responsible Business award together with relevant government agencies, other business associations, and social partners, mandating its presentation to laureates at our annual congresses.\n\nFor your information, we held this awards ceremony today. The winners include PhosAgro, Metalloinvest, Severstal, and Norilsk Nickel. Laureates comprise Russian Railways, Gazprom, SIBUR, RUSAL, and perhaps the less widely known company Pigment. Several other winners were recognised in specific categories of socially responsible corporate conduct. Overall, over two years, this award has proven effective in mobilising not only large corporations publishing non-financial reports - a criterion you emphasised two years ago - but also medium-sized enterprises now emulating this practice. We will compile the two-year experience of administering this award and possibly adjust certain provisions to broaden corporate participation, then report our findings to you. Next year's laureates may include more entities unfamiliar to you.\n\nAt this point, Mr President, I would like to thank you, particularly as Dmitry Peskov indicated that you have a conversation scheduled with Donald Trump until 6 PM.\n\nVladimir Putin: Never mind - that's his job.\n\nAlexander Shokhin: I don't know. We'll have to see how Trump reacts to this remark - he enjoys interviews and may respond promptly.\n\nVladimir Putin: I referenced Peskov, not Trump.\n\nAlexander Shokhin: He will note our discussion.\n\nBut given your exceptionally packed agenda today and in coming days, I would indeed like to thank you and conclude this public portion of our conversation, resuming discussions later with RUIE bureau members and aligned major enterprises not yet affiliated. Perhaps RUIE membership should serve as an entry ticket?\n\nVladimir Putin: Do RUIE members receive privileges?\n\nAlexander Shokhin: Well, we organise the congress. A longstanding tradition holds that after the public session, a meeting with the RUIE bureau follows. We have 30 bureau members in total. Do you know how many are attending today? Nearly 90 people.\n\nVladimir Putin: So, no need to depart? (Laughter in the hall.)\n\nAlexander Shokhin: These are the aligned ones. (Laughter.) Thus, there are effectively no privileges except the sense of responsibility towards their employees and the Constitution, where social partnership is enshrined.\n\nIn truth, beyond formalities, genuinely responsible companies are present here - those envisioning not only their own future through financial growth metrics, etc., but also contemplating the nation's future. This aligns with your remarks today about Russian businesses successfully filling vacated niches, pursuing technological sovereignty and leadership, while implementing social programmes.\n\nBy the way, redomiciliation, i.e. the process of the Russian companies returning to Russian jurisdiction from abroad, from the offshore areas, was a hot topic two years ago. This process is now almost complete thanks largely to our discussions and the effective work of our colleagues from the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of Economic Development, and the State Duma. In this sense, there is no other place to invest but Russia. Thanks, as you pointed out, also go to those who are imposing sanctions on us.\n\nVladimir Putin: No, investing elsewhere is okay. The world is vast, and you should make investments that are lucrative for you and Russia. The rates of return are high, and investments are reliably protected. There are many regions like that around the world.\n\nWe have colleagues in this audience who invest in Africa and Asia. They need to make investments elsewhere to support the production here. Some companies invest, while others relocate their production facilities, because it is easier for them to work on the global markets from there.\n\nI know quite a lot, since we meet regularly. There are investment opportunities. There are countries that, as you are aware, have so much money in all kinds of funds that they do not know what to do with it. The main character in Kalina Krasnaya film famously said that the inordinate amount of money he had on him was \"burning his leg.\" Remember? That is a problem for them. The funds in their possession are huge, enormous, sky high piles of money. So, what is this money doing stashed somewhere out there, in these, pardon the language, lame jurisdictions? What is there to do with this money, what will become of it? Everyone is pondering it, everyone is thinking hard about it. You are well aware of it. Everyone is thinking about the future of the funds that are kept in Western banks. Everyone is thinking about it. Well, of course, this sent a message that reverberated across the global economy. We need to look for investment opportunities which abound. Of course, the state must ensure the interests of Russian businesses. This is true. However, the economy of our country, Russia itself, must be this safe haven. Of course, we still have a lot to accomplish.\n\nI know, they are not saying it now. We will probably meet as a small group, although 90 companies is not really a small group. We also need to work with law enforcement. You may have heard me say at every meeting with the boards - tomorrow, I think, I will speak at the Prosecutor's Office - that it is imperative to protect the interests of the Russian business, and to do our best to make sure that our legal system encourages businesses to come here without second thoughts, and that the judicial system is independent and efficient. We need to accomplish a lot more. I understand everything. Believe me, we will do everything to make this happen.\n\nWhat is good about the way things are abroad? They freeze everything and take everything away rudely in a manner that is not civilised at all. I am not even talking about legal systems which simply do not exist, and even if they do they only serve their own interests. That is what this is all about, you see?\n\nBy the way, I took note of that in the political sphere a long time ago. I will not name any names, but here is a situation: they are discussing a political issue and say we will do this, this, and that, and you think to yourself what the heck? Sometimes, I would point out that it cannot be done that way because it contradicts this and that...\" They would then tell me, \"Well, it is okay, it does, but it is a viable solution.\" That is all. These approaches have been applied in politics for a long time now. Now, these practices are rife in the economic sphere as well.\n\nSo, we cannot trust, but we need to create such a political system and to build such a legal and law enforcement practice in our country. We need to work on it as a team in order to make it a solid, stable and reliable system. I think the way this work has been unfolding between the business community and the Government in recent years sets a good example.\n\nJoin the RUIE! (Laughter in the audience.)\n\nAlexander Shokhin: Friends, I propose concluding the public segment of the meeting on this optimistic note.\n\nThank you, Mr President, for your participation and your kind words.\n\nVladimir Putin: Thank you for inviting me.\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A further push was made in 2021.\n\nIn contrast, the latest discussions saw \"meaningful progress\", the UN chief insisted. \"I hope that the confidence-building measures or the initiatives to build trust, together with the decision to have very soon a next meeting and the acceptance by all of the appointment of a Special Envoy on Cyprus to prepare the next steps, demonstrates the sense of commitment and the sense of urgency that I believe were extremely important.

        "full_text": "So What Did Putin and Trump Agree On? A Partial Ukraine Cease-Fire Anyway.\n\nBy Mike Eckel March 18, 2025\n\nIt's a cease-fire. But what kind of cease-fire?\n\nMore than three years into the Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine, the White House and the Kremlin on March 18 announced a broad agreement aimed at pausing a conflict that has killed and wounded more than 1 million men on both sides.\n\nThe contours of the deal were announced after a roughly two-hour phone call between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin - the second such call of Trump's presidency, and arguably the most consequential to date.\n\nUkraine, under intense pressure from the White House that included an acrimonious Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had already signed on to the US proposal for a 30-day pause in fighting, with the caveat that Russia had to as well.\n\nSo What did Moscow Agree to Exactly?\n\n\"My main conclusion here is that Moscow is quite comfortable with Trump, but for reasons other than almost everyone discusses,\" Nikolai Sokov, a former Russian diplomat who is now with the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told RFE/RL. \"Moscow can bargain with Trump whereas Europe insists its position is right and should be accepted without bargaining.\"\n\nWhere actual military action is concerned, the agreement does nothing on the battlefield itself, where Russian troops have, until recently, been grinding down Ukrainian defenses along a 1,100-kilometer front line.\n\nUkraine's troops are withdrawing from Russia's Kursk region, which it invaded nearly seven months ago in a bid to relieve pressure elsewhere on the front lines, and also gain a bargaining chip for future peace talks.\n\nProminent in the deal announced March 18 is the focus on energy infrastructure.\n\nSince at least November 2022, Russia has pummeled Ukraine's power grid: power stations, transmission lines, transformers, substations\u2014a strategy aimed at exhausting and terrorizing Ukraine's civilian population, sometimes attributed to the former top commander of the Russian invasion whose nickname is General Armageddon.\n\n(Attacking civilian infrastructure is also allegedly a war crime, for which the International Criminal Court has brought charges against two top Russian military officers.)\n\nIn the face of those attacks, Ukraine has struggled to keep the lights -- and heat -- on, but has managed to muddle through with a mix of local ingenuity and large-scale Western support. At the same time, Ukraine has ramped up its homegrown industry of drones, and even cruise missiles, which has increasingly used to target Russia's energy infrastructure: oil refineries, pipelines, and military facilities.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Helsinki, President Zelenskyy, who in the past has signaled support for a cease-fire exclusive of ground actions, appeared to sprinkle cold water on the new deal.\n\n\"We always supported the idea not to hit energy targets, as well as targets at sea, food production and transport targets,\" he said after the Kremlin-White House phone call was announced. \"Now, we need to understand what the details of this agreement are. We don't know that.\"\n\n\"This could be a way to move towards a cease-fire,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Step by step. The rest though is the statistics of the reality: hundreds of drones and missiles that keep raining not on the battlefield but all over.\"\n\nThe groundwork for the cease-fire was announced in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia after meetings of Ukrainian and US delegations. Two days after, Putin responded to the proposal with what amounted to a \"yes, but\" reply.\n\n\"During the conversation, Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days,\" the Kremlin said in its read-out of the March 18 call. \"Vladimir Putin responded positively to the initiative and immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order.\"\n\nA limited cessation of targeting on energy facilities in Ukraine - and in Russia - is a win for Kyiv.\n\nHowever, it may end up being more of a win for Moscow, Sokov said.\n\n\"Note that for 30 days Russia will be building weapons and will be able to resume large-scale strikes if necessary,\" he told RFE/RL. \"Ukraine, however, will not be able to fully fix damage to energy infrastructure, of which it has lost between one-third and one-half according to different estimates.\"\n\nLeft Unsaid\n\nWhat was absent from the talks - at least in the public read-outs from the Kremlin and the White House was any mention of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant - Europe's largest - which US envoy Steve Witkoff said might be on the table.\n\nNor was there mention of US recognition of Russia's claim to have annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, something else that was rumored to be possible.\n\nNor was there reference to Ukraine's ambitions to join NATO, something Moscow vehemently opposes, and even cited as a justification for its decision to invade in February 2022.\n\nThe White House statement did mention broader geopolitical issues\u2014 a nod toward a position Moscow has leaning into: that any deal with Washington should be a wider deal touching on issues unrelated to Ukraine.\n\nThat's a recurring theme for Putin who's used the term \"root causes\" - shorthand for the Kremlin's dissatisfaction with the entire post-Cold War international arrangement.\n\nBut broadening talks beyond Ukraine itself was something that Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, resisted.\n\n\"The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full cease-fire and permanent peace,\" the White House said. \"These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application,\" it said. \"The two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel.\"\n\nIt was also unclear whether the subtle difference in wording between statements was significant: \"energy infrastructure\" per the Kremlin versus \"energy and infrastructure\" per the White House.\n\nAnd proliferation of strategic weapons - nuclear or otherwise- has in the past been an easy goal that Washington and Moscow have shared, until distrust and political suspicions seeped into the effort.\n\nThe two countries - who hold the world's two largest nuclear arsenals - are still bound by the last major arms control treaty between them, though it's due to lapse next year, and there's been no effort at all to start talks on a successor treaty.\n\nIn the end, though, broadening the scope of discussions fits into the Kremlin's wider hopes for a wider rework on international rules: Moscow's desire to be treated as an equal by the United States\u2014as it was during the Soviet Union.\n\nSource: https://www.rferl.org/a/trump-putin-ukraine-kremlin- white-house-call/33352009.html\n\nCopyright (c) 2025.

(AFNS) -- The Airmen of the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing moved 1,076 passengers, carried 900 tons of cargo and transported 120,000 gallons of fuel during their annual support for science in Antarctica from October 2024 to February 2025.\n\nThe 109th AW executed 79 missions using its ski-equipped LC-130 Hercules, transporting personnel, cargo and fuel to key research sites across the continent, including the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and a research station on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\n\nThe wing's operations are part of Operation Deep Freeze, the Defense Department's annual mission to provide logistical support to the National Science Foundation in Antarctica.\n\nFive aircraft and 400 deployed to McMurdo Station, the hub of U.S. operations in Antarctica, during the course of the five-month support season.\n\nThe unit accomplished nine medical evacuations throughout the season.\n\nOne of these missions included a civilian logistics specialist who suffered a myocardial infarction. He was transported to Christchurch New Zealand, where he was discharged and sent home to recover a week later.\n\nThe partnership between the National Science Foundation and the military was key to ensuring rapid medical care and evacuation of the patient, said Maj. Thomas Powell, McMurdo Station flight surgeon.\n\nThe 109th faced challenging weather conditions and complex logistical demands this season but completed missions safely and efficiently, said Col. Rob Donaldson, 109th AW commander.\n\nThe 109th AW Airmen's efforts supported the NSF's ongoing studies in climate science, glaciology and environmental research.\n\n\"The dedication and professionalism of our mission-ready Airmen continue to be the backbone of this mission,\" Donaldson said.\n\n\"From our pilots and aircrew to our maintainers and support personnel, every member of this team plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and effective operations in one of the most demanding environments on the planet,\" Donaldson added.\n\nAs the Antarctic summer comes to an end, the unit's personnel and aircraft have returned to Stratton Air National Guard Base, N.Y.\n\nThe wing will begin preparations for future missions, including science support missions in Greenland, which begin in April.\n\nThe wing also supports military operations. Aircraft and Airmen from the 109th AW recently took part in Canadian Forces exercise Operation Nanook-Nunalivut, where they built an ice runway and landed a C-130 Hercules on a frozen lake.\n\nThe 109th AW is the only unit in the U.S. military equipped with ski-equipped LC-130s, making it uniquely capable of supporting scientific and military missions in polar regions.\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the US and Russia, the White House said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, they agreed to \"immediately\" launch technical negotiations on the implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, as well as on the full ceasefire and permanent peace in Ukraine, according to the White House.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how Ukraine will respond to the limited ceasefire plan. Kiev has said it is ready to accept the 30-day truce proposed by Trump, but the White House did not suggest that Putin had agreed to sign off on it, Xinhua reported.\n\nThe White House also didn't mention if Putin, during the talk, demanded the suspension of foreign military aid to Ukraine during the ceasefire, nor issues on land concessions and the future of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, according to Xinhua.\n\nPutin \"immediately gave the Russian military the appropriate command\" in response to Trump's proposal for Russia and Ukraine to mutually stop striking energy infrastructures, the Kremlin's press service said after the phone call, according to Xinhua.\n\n\"A future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved,\" said the White House statement.\n\nRegarding Iran and the Middle East, the White House said \"the two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel,\" while discussing US-Russia \"potential cooperation\" in the Middle East to prevent future conflicts in the region.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer reiterated UK's \"unwavering support\" for Ukraine in a phone talk with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday evening, according to a Downing Street statement.\n\n\"The prime minister spoke to President Zelensky this evening.

He welcomed the Trump-Putin discussions as \"moving in the right direction,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nPresident Zelensky told reporters he hopes to learn details of the phone conversation between US President Trump and Russian President Putin from the US leader, TASS reported.\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Steven S. Nordhaus today during the McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Washington.\n\n\"We are at a pivotal moment in history, a time when the security of our homeland faces challenges from near-peer adversaries who are relentless in their pursuit of advancing capabilities and strategic advantages,\" he said.\n\nNordhaus described how, with sophisticated systems and advanced technologies, those adversaries are working to close the gap and said, \"we cannot allow that to happen.\"\n\nHe added that accelerating and reforming the acquisition processes is critical, as is leveraging the \"incredible ingenuity\" of warfighters; innovation is the fuel that drives readiness and establishes credible deterrence.\n\n\"It's the difference between reacting to a threat and anticipating it. It is the ability to turn a drone into a force multiplier, to harness artificial intelligence for real-time decision-making,\" he said.\n\nNordhaus said every guardsman must be empowered to think creatively, experiment, embrace risk and sometimes fail and try again.\n\n\"We have something that our adversaries can't replicate - the ingenuity of the American spirit embodied in the warrior ethos of our citizen soldiers and citizen airmen.\"\n\nThe National Guard has about 430,000 members, and about one-third of them serve on active duty. The remainder split their time between civilian professions and military service, creating a cross-cutting effect that fosters adaptive, innovative problem-solving. Because of this dynamic, Nordhaus said guardsmen bring innovative civilian job skills in cutting-edge areas like technology and cyber.\n\nRegarding expenditures, Nordhaus said the National Guard is reviewing and redirecting funds to the warfighting mission and innovation. It also partners with industry and the other service branches, noting that the Guard has 115 global military partners.\n\nThe Guard is also focused on retention and recruiting, he said, pointing out that the number trendlines over the past three months have been positive.\n\n\"The Guard is a great place to work. ... our motto is 'Always Ready, Always There,' and I know our guardsmen, when they get called, they move out,\" Nordhaus said.\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n"
